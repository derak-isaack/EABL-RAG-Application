Looking Ahead
Despite 
the 
operating 
environment 
Overview
I
t gives me great pleasure to share with 
you the strides our Company made in 
fiscal year 2023. Despite operating in 
an increasingly tough macro-economic 
environment, coupled with geopolitical 
disruptions 
which 
disproportionately 
raised our costs and depressed consumer 
spending, the Group remained resilient and 
delivered a respectable performance.
Multiple excise tax increases in the course 
of the financial year continued to have a 
lagging effect on consumers’ spending 
power, leading to slower offtake of our 
products. Amid these challenges, we 
maintained our strategic focus and agility 
on delivering value to our consumers and 
all our stakeholders through executional 
excellence and operational efficiency.  
Regional Operating Environment 
As mentioned above, in the last fiscal year, 
the business navigated an increasingly 
complex operating landscape characterised 
by a host of macroeconomic headwinds. 
The regional economic slowdown and 
inflationary pressure not only impacted 
consumers’ disposable incomes but also 
significantly increased the cost of doing 
business.
Additionally, local currency depreciation, 
higher taxes and rising interest rates mainly 
in Kenya further impacted our business 
performance. During the year, we witnessed 
volume contraction as consumers adjusted 
their purchasing behaviour due to reduced 
disposable income. The economic recession 
has also led to a resurgence in illicit trade 
as some consumers move to cheaper 
unregulated products.

pamoja na uwekezaji mwingine mkubwa 
katika mikakati mingine ya maendeleo

Kwa Ufupi
N
i 
furaha 
kubwa 
kwangu 
kuwafahamisha hatua zilizopigwa 
na Kampuni yetu katika mwaka 
wa kifedha wa 2023. Licha ya kuendesha 
shughuli zetu katika mazingira ya kiuchumi 
yanayoendelea kuwa magumu pamoja 
na matukio ya kisiasa ambayo yalichangia 
kuongezeka kwa gharama zetu mwaka huo 
na kuathiri uwezo wa wateja kununua bidhaa, 
Kundi liliendelea kuwa na ukakamavu na 
kuhakikisha matokeo ya kuridhisha.
Kadhalika, kuongezwa kwa kodi ya bidhaa 
mara kadha, katika mwaka huo, kuliendelea 
kuathiri uwezo wa mteja kufanya manunuzi. 
Hii ilichangia kushuka kwa mauzo ya bidhaa 
zetu. Lakini licha ya changamoto hizo, 
tuliendelea kuangazia lengo letu la mkakati 
na kuwa na wepesi wa kuchukua hatua 
katika kuwasilisha thamani kwa wateja wetu 
na wadau wetu wote. Tulifanya hivyo kupitia 
ustadi katika utekelezaji wa shughuli zetu, 
na kuboresha na kuimarisha uendeshaji wa 
shughuli zetu.  
Mazingira 
ya 
Uendeshaji 
Shughuli 
katika Kanda
Kama nilivyoeleza hapa juu, katika mwaka 
wa kifedha uliopita, biashara yetu ililazimika 
kupitia mazingira ya uendeshaji shughuli 
yaliyojawa na changamoto za kiuchumi. 
Kupungua kwa kasi ya ukuaji wa uchumi 
katika kanda Pamoja na shinikizo za mfumko 
wa bei viliathiri kiasi cha pesa za matumizi 
ya hiari upande wa wateja na pia kuongeza 
gharama ya uendeshaji biashara.
Kadhalika, kudorora kwa thamani ya sarafu, 
kodi ya juu, na kuongezeka kwa viwango vya 
riba, hasa nchini Kenya ni mambo ambayo 
yaliathiri matokeo ya biashara yetu. Katika 
mwaka huo, tulishuhudia kupungua kwa 
kiasi cha bidhaa tulizouza baada ya wateja 
kulazimika kubadilisha mtindo wao wa 
matumizi kutokana na kupungua kwa pesa

wa faida wa mwisho wa  KShs 1.75 kwa kila 
hisa, ambao utafikisha jumla ya mgawo wa 
faida kwa mwaka huo kuwa  Kshs 5.50 kwa

Kutazama Mbele
Licha ya changamoto katika mazingira ya 
uendeshaji shughuli, Bodi inatilia mkazo 
imani yake kwenye mkakati wetu  na 
kujitolea kwetu katika kuhakikisha ukuaji 
endelevu. Kama Kampuni, tutaendelea 
kuwatumikia wateja wetu kwa kuangazia 
ustadi na weledi katika uandaaji wa bidhaa 
zetu, uwekezaji katika nembo zetu thabiti, 
na kudhibiti matumizi pamoja na kuwekeza 
kwa busara. Bado tumejitolea kuwa kiongozi 
katika uhifadhi wa mazingira, uwajibikaji 
kwa jamii na maamuzi na hatua za kiutawala 
zinazoendana na maadili yetu na kuhakikisha 
uendelevu wa kipindi kirefu.

Bodi ina furaha kumkaribisha Bw. Sathish 
Krishnan kama Mkurugenzi asiye Mtendaji 
kuanzia Julai 27, 2023. Bw. Krishnan analeta 
uzoefu wake kama mtaalamu wa masuala ya 
kifedha aliyebobea, mwanachama wa bodi 
na kiongozi wa mashirika mwenye uzoefu

makubwa ya kimataifa.
Bodi pia ina furaha kumkaribisha John 
Musunga kama Mkurugenzi asiye Mtendaji 
kuanzia Julai 1, 2023. Kama mnavyokumbuka, 
John alikuwa akihudumu kama Meneja 
Mkurugenzi wa Kenya Breweries Limited.
Japheth Katto, mkurugenzi aliyehudumu 
kipindi kirefu na ambaye alikuwa Mwenyekiti 
wa Uganda Breweries Limited alistaafu 
kutoka nafasi yake kama Mkurugenzi wa 
Kampuni mnamo Februari 28, 2023. 
Dayalan Nayager, Rais wa Diageo wa Afrika, 
pia alijiuzulu mwaka huo wa kifedha baada

three and five percent, respectively. We 
recorded slight declines in beer and new 
frontier drinks, with the challenges in Kenya 
the biggest contributor to this. Uganda 
delivered a strong performance on the back 
of premiumisation, Route To Consumer 
development and strategic pricing.
The effect of the stress was a twenty one 
percent decline in net profit to Kshs12 billion, 
but it was nevertheless a good result that we 
can continue to build on as we maintain our 
strategic focus on delivering value to our 
consumers and all our stakeholders through 
execution 
excellence 
and 
operational 
efficiency.  
Sustainability 
Our work in Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) is as important as our 
financial performance, and we are keen not 
only on our reputation but on ensuring that 
we maintain our social licence to operate. 
We remain guided by our sustainability 
strategy, Society 2030: Spirit of Progress, to 
help create a more inclusive and sustainable 
world. Since we published our inaugural 
Sustainability Report in 2021, we have 
been keen on reporting on our progress in 
implementing our plan. 
SMASHED, our initiative to create awareness 
on the perils of underage drinking, reached 
338,550 students across schools in Kenya, 
Uganda and Tanzania and aims to reach still 
more teenagers across the region. 
In the “Wrong Side of the Road" campaign, 
we continued to sustain and develop our 
partnership with the National Transport and 
Safety Authority in Kenya and to work with 
influencers and Traffic Police in Uganda and 
Tanzania on responsible drinking to enhance 
road safety. 
Overview
O
ver the past fiscal year, the word most 
used to describe the environment 
in which we have been operating 
has been ‘tough’, and it was evident in 
households and countries as well as the 
market in Eastern Africa and the Great Lakes 
region in which we operate. Discretionary 
spending reduced as the cost of living 
has gone up, with the increased cost of 
energy the main culprit, exacerbated by the 
continued effects of the global geopolitical 
tensions and a devastating drought in Kenya 
partly blamed on climate change. 
The key impact of inflation on our business 
was felt in the cost of manufacturing, where 
the cost of grains increased by thirty one 
percent, logistics by fourteen percent, 
electricity by forty percent, and neutral 
spirits by sixty one percent. The cost of glass 
also went up significantly in Kenya after the 
introduction of a twenty five per cent tax 
on imported glass. On the regulatory front, 
we experienced in Kenya several excise 
tax increments with the business having 
to absorb the compounded effect of the 
increase via the Finance Act 2022 and the 
inflationary adjustment. The worsened 
macro environment was in full effect in the 
second half of fiscal year 2023. 
It is therefore with much pride that I report 
a resilient performance on the back of a 
challenging operating environment.
Performance 
Our net sales were unchanged from last year, 
at Kshs110 billion, with growth in Uganda 
at seventeen percent and Tanzania at one 
percent, offset by a decline of four percent 
in Kenya. Growth was driven by two of our 
four imperatives, mainstream spirits and 
premium, which delivered an additional 
Group CEO’s Statement
It is therefore with much pride that I report 
a resilient performance on the back of a

We are confident that with sustained 
investment in brand-building, exciting 
innovations and excellent commercial execution, 
we shall continue on the trajectory of sustainable 
growth. 
We have been at the forefront of 
driving awareness of the perils of 
illicit alcohol in the region. In Kenya, 
we partnered with industry associations 
and the national and county governments 
to create awareness among the public and 
to the law and tax enforcement authorities 
to clamp down on emerging trends in 
the consumption of illicit alcohol. We 
have completed detailed research on the 
prevalence of illicit alcohol in Kenya that 
we hope will guide policy-making and in 
cracking down on illicit alcohol. 
One of our most significant achievements in 
ESG was the operationalisation of biomass 
plants in Kampala, Kisumu and Nairobi, 
which has brought us up to the point where 
we are using renewable energy in sixty five 
percent of our operations. 
We have continued to make progress in our 
goals of championing inclusion and diversity 
and pioneering grain-to-glass sustainability 
(read more on page 78 and page 79).  
Looking into the future  
While we expect the headwinds to persist, 
we are keen on continuing to stick to our 
strategy. We do this knowing that like some 
of the challenges we have faced in the past, 
like the Covid-19 pandemic, we will weather 
the challenges at some point. 
We 
will 
therefore 
continue 
investing 
behind our brands, building a vibrant beer 
category, exploding mainstream spirits, 
winning in premium and innovating to 
shape new frontiers. We will also continue 
to invest in our Route To Consumer, which 
we believe will remain our competitive 
edge. We continue to invest in our supply 
footprint by making capital expenditures in 
our plants across the region. We will do this 
so that as we emerge stronger from these 
challenges, we can deliver better results to 
our shareholders, as we have done. 
We are confident that with sustained 
investment in brand-building, exciting 
innovations 
and 
excellent 
commercial 
execution, we shall continue on the 
trajectory of sustainable growth.

Matokeo 
Mauzo yetu halisi hayakubadilika sana kutoka 
mwaka uliopita, ambapo yalikuwa bado 
KSh110 bilioni. Ukuaji wa asilimia kumi na 
saba nchini Uganda na asilimia moja nchini 
Tanzania ulifutwa na kupungua kwa mauzo 
halisi kwa asilimia nne nchini Kenya. Ukuaji 
ulichangiwa na vitengo viwili kati ya vinne 
vya bidhaa zetu, pombe kali za kawaida 
na za bei ya juu, ambazo zilichangia ukuaji 
wa asilimia tatu na tano mtawalia. Mauzo 
yetu yalishuka kiasi katika bia na vinywaji 
vigeni, ambapo changamoto katika soko 
letu Kenya ndizo zilizochangia pakubwa 
kupungua huko. Uganda kwa kiwango 
kikubwa ilisalia kuwa imara, kutokana na hali 
kwamba kulikuwa na shinikizo chache sana 
za kiuchumi katika soko hilo.
Matokeo ya changamoto zilizotokea ilikuwa 
ni kushuka kwa asilimia 21 katika faida 
halisi hadi KSh12 bilioni. Hata hivyo, hayo 
yalikuwa bado ni matokeo mazuri ambayo 
tunaweza kuyatumia na kuendelea kujijenga 
tukiendelea kuangazia mkakati wetu wa 
kuhakikisha tunatoa thamani kwa watumiaji 
wa bidhaa zetu na wadau wetu wote kupitia 
ustadi na weledi katika uendeshaji wa 
shughuli zetu.
Uendelevu 
Kazi yetu katika Mazingira, Jamii na Utawala 
 
(ESG) ina umuhimu wa kiwango sawa na 
matokeo yetu ya kifedha. Na tuna nia, sio 
tu ya kuboresha sifa zetu kama kampuni, 
lakini pia kuhakikisha tuna manufaa kwa

Kwa Ufupi
K
atika mwaka wa kifedha uliopita, 
neno lililotumika mara nyingi kueleza 
mazingira ya uendeshaji shughuli 
ambayo tuliyapitia ni ‘magumu’. Na hili ni 
dhahiri kwa jamii na mataifa, pamoja na katika 
masoko ambayo tunaendesha shughuli zetu 
kanda za Afrika Mashariki na Maziwa Makuu. 
Kiwango cha matumizi ya hiari kwa watu 
wengi kilipungua kutokana na kupanda kwa 
gharama ya maisha. Kupanda kwa gharama 
ya mafuta na nishati kulichangia zaidi, lakini 
pia mambo yalifanywa magumu zaidi na 
kuendelea kwa athari za misukosuko ya 
kisiasa duniani na ukame mbaya Kenya 
ambao kwa kiwango fulani unatokana na 
mabadiliko ya tabia nchi.
Athari kuu zaidi ya mfumko wa bei katika 
biashara yetu ilikuwa ni katika gharama ya 
uzalishaji wa bidhaa viwandani. Gharama ya 
nafaka iliongezeka kwa asilimia 31, mipango 
na usafirishaji kwa asilimia 14, umeme 
kwa asilimia 40, na pombe kali ambayo 
haijawekwa ladha kwa asilimia 61. Gharama 
ya gilasi pia ilipanda pakubwa Kenya baada 
ya kodi ya asilimia 25 kuanza kutozwa 
katika uagizaji wa gilasi kutoka nje ya nchi. 
Katika upande wa kisheria na usimamizi, 
nchini Kenya tulishuhudia, katika kipindi 
cha miezi 14 iliyopita, ongezeko la juu zaidi 
la kodi ya bidhaa kuwahi kushuhudiwa. 
Biashara ililazimika kubeba mzigo wa 
nyongeza hiyo iliyotekelezwa kupitia Sheria 
ya Kifedha ya mwaka 2022, na pia mfumko 
wa bei. Kudorora kwa mazingira ya kiuchumi 
kuliuma zaidi katika nusu ya pili ya mwaka 
wa kifedha wa 2023. 
Kwa hivyo, ni kwa kujionea fahari kubwa, 
ambapo ninawasilisha kwenu mwaka wa 
matokeo thabiti katika mazingira magumu 
ya uendeshaji shughuli.

SMASHED, 
mkakati 
wetu 
wa 
kutoa 
uhamasisho kuhusu hatari za watoto kunywa 
pombe, uliwafikia wanafunzi 305,628 katika 
shule mbalimbali nchini Kenya na Tanzania, 
na zaidi ya shule 50 nchini Uganda. Mkakati 
huo unalenga kuwafikia vijana wengi 
waliobalehe kote katika kanda.
Katika “Wrong Side of the Road campaign” 
kwa maana ya Upande Usiofaa wa 
Barabara, 
tuliendelea 
kuendeleza 
na 
kukuza ushirikiano wetu na Mamlaka ya 
Taifa ya Uchukuzi na Usalama Barabarani 
Kenya (NTSA) na kufanya kazi na watu 
wenye ushawishi kwa umma na Polisi wa 
Trafiki Uganda na Tanzania kuhusu unywaji 
pombe wa kuwajibika ili kuimarisha usalama 
barabarani. 
Tumekuwa kwenye mstari wa mbele katika 
kuongeza uhamasisho kuhusu madhara 
ya pombe haramu katika kanda hii. Nchini 
Kenya, tumeshirikiana na vyama vya wadau 
katika sekta hii pamoja na serikali ya taifa 
na za kaunti kuhamasisha umma. Pia, 
tumeshirikiana na mamlaka za kisheria na za 
utekelezaji wa sheria katika kukabiliana na 
unywaji wa pombe haramu. Tumekamilisha 
utafiti wa kina kuhusu kuenea kwa pombe 
haramu nchini Kenya na ni matumaini yetu 
kwamba utafiti huo utaongoza maandalizi 
ya sera na katika vita dhidi ya pombe 
haramu.
Moja ya mafanikio yetu makuu zaidi katika 
ESG  ilikuwa ni kuanza kazi kwa kiwanda 
chetu cha kawi hai Kampala, Kisumu 
na Nairobi. Hii imetufikisha katika hatua 
ambapo sasa tunatumia kawi safi katika 
asilimia sitini na tano ya shughuli zetu.
Tumeendelea kupiga hatua katika malengo

Ingawa tunatarajia changamoto zitaendelea 
kuwepo, 
tumejitolea 
kuendelea 
na 
mkakati wetu. Tunafanya hivi tukifahamu 
kwamba sawa na ilivyotokea kwa baadhi 
ya changamoto tulizokumbana nazo awali, 
kwa mfano janga la Covid-19, tutazishinda 
na kupita changamoto hizi wakati fulani. 
Kwa hivyo, tutaendelea kuwekeza katika 
nembo zetu, kujenga kitengo cha bia 
zinazopendwa, vileo vikali vya kawaida, na 
kushinda katika vileo vikali vya thamani ya 
juu na pia kufanya uvumbuzi wa vinywaji

ushindani wetu. Tutaendelea kuwekeza 
katika mfumo wa watu wanaotuuzia bidhaa 
kwa kufanya uwekezaji kwenye viwanda 
vyetu kote katika kanda. Tutafanya hivyo 
ili tuibuke tukiwa imara zaidi kutoka kwa 
changamoto hizi. Tunaweza kutoa matokeo 
mema zaidi kwa wenyehisa wetu, kama 
tulivyofanya sasa.
Tuna imani kwamba kupitia ustadi wetu wa

Overview
T
he operating environment has been tough as headwinds 
in the macroeconomic environment, including inflation, 
currency depreciation and several disruptions in trade have 
impacted our business. We have particularly felt significant impact 
from inflation on the cost of our inputs.
Consumers are also feeling the effects, as research shows that 
consumers share of wallet in East Africa for Total Beverage (TBA) has 
shrunk from 7% pre-covid to 5% in 2023, with the consumers changing 
frequency of consumption, and/or downgrading in categories and 
price points. The price sensitive mainstream beer category and 
shaping new frontiers category driven by the Senator brand have 
especially been pressured by the macros. 
Despite these hurdles, the Group’s performance remained largely 
resilient delivering flat top line and the 2nd highest profit after tax in 
the last six years, whilst largely meeting our targets on our key ratios. 
We remained on strategy continuing to invest in our brands, launch 
innovations, and invest in our route to consumer while leveraging 
digital transformation. We are investing ahead in capex for long term 
growth while optimising our business for cost-efficiency. We also 
continued to invest in our people, the real engine for our growth as 
well as in the communities in which we operate. 
Performance Review 
Net sales came in flat at Kshs 109.6 bn (2022: Kshs 109.4bn) with 
strong growth in the spirits category offset by performance in the 
beer category which was more impacted by the multiple excise 
increases during the year. Pricing and improved mix benefits 
were offset by volume declines, especially in the mainstream beer 
category. 
Earnings before income and tax (EBIT) declined 14.4% below last 
year at Kshs 24.2billion (2022: Kshs 28.3 billion) with an EBIT margin 
decline to 22.1% (2022: 25.8%). The effect of price taken delivered 
8.5% to the EBIT margin, fully offsetting the 5.1% impact of excise 
increases. However, volume declines had an adverse 1.9% impact on 
Group CFO’s Statement
the efficiency of our fixed cost absorption. The impact of inflation in 
cost of inputs of Kshs 9.2 billion, particularly on neutral spirit, grain, 
electricity, fuel and glass, took 11.3% off our EBIT margin, which we 
were partly able to mitigate with Kshs 4.2 billion in productivity 
savings delivering back 4.4% into the EBIT margin.  Mix improvement 
due to the growth of premium category delivered 0.5%, and 
efficiency in expense management brought in an additional 3.5% 
which offset the 2.1% impact of foreign exchange (FX) on our 
bottom line landing us at 22.1% EBIT margin.
Net finance costs came in 29.5% higher at Kshs 5.4 billion, reflective 
of the increased debt level we’re holding primarily to fund capex 
spend, but also reflective of the rising interest rate environment. Our 
effective interest rate increased slightly from 9.9% to 10.4% even as 
the Central Bank Rate (CBR) rate went up from 7.5 to 10.5%.
We had an improvement in our tax efficiency with effective tax rate 
(ETR), closing at 34.1% compared to 35.2% in 2022. 
Resultantly, we reported a Profit after tax of Kshs 12.3 billion (2022: 
Kshs 15.6 bn), a decline of 20.9%.
The profit attributable to equity holders declined 16.9% to Kshs 9.8 
billion (2022: Kshs 11.9 billion) reflecting the decline in profitability, 
while the non-controlling interests (NCI) declined 33.7% to Kshs 
2.5 billion (2022: Kshs 3.7 billion) reflecting the impact of inflation 
particularly of ethanol on the spirits business. 
Earnings Per Share 
Earnings per share reduced 16.9% to Kshs 12.47 (2022: Kshs 
15.00), reflecting the decline in profitability.  The Directors have 
recommended a final dividend for the year of Kshs 1.75 (2022: Kshs 
7.25), which will be put to the shareholders for approval at the 
Annual General Meeting. We declared an interim dividend of Kshs 
3.75 per share (2022: Kshs 3.75) bringing the total payout for the year 
to Kshs 5.5 per share (2022: Kshs 11.00). 
While our dividend policy is to give out a payout of 70% of earnings 
after tax, subject to the shape of our balance sheet, the level of our 
key ratios and with that and the continuing volatility in the operating 
environment we considered it prudent to reduce the payout in order 
to navigate this period and deleverage the balance sheet.
Balance Sheet
The Group closed at a Net Debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.6 slightly above 
the Board target of 1.5, as Net debt grew 45% to Kshs 51.2 billion 
(2022: Kshs 35.2 billion) primarily on account of the increased long-

Growth in Cash Generation 
Net cash from operations declined to Kshs 26.1 billion (2022: Kshs 
35.3 billion). Of this Kshs 5.5 billion was paid out in interest costs and 
Kshs 9.6 billion was paid up in taxes of which prior year consisted of 
Kshs 4.2 billion in relation to the final tax of F22 income and current 
year installment taxes of Kshs 5.4 billion. The strong cash generation 
was used to invest in long-term growth in relation to the investments 
in capex. Financing activities comprising net increase in borrowings 
offset by dividends paid during the year contributed to the growth 
in cash and cash equivalents by the end of the year at Kshs 9.0 billion 
(2022: Kshs 8.1 billion). 
Looking ahead 
The business environment is continuing to face tough challenges. 
However, despite these hurdles our unwavering focus on our long-
term strategy together with the resilience and drive of our people 
are playing a crucial role in steering the company through the 
turbulence. We remain close to the changing consumer dynamics 
and continue to invest in our strong brands which are our source of 
competitive advantage. We will continue to embed efficiency in our 
operations and in our costs to protect the bottom line.
Our business remains in good shape, and we are taking all the right 
actions to deliver long term sustainable value for all our stakeholders 
and a positive impact to the communities in which we operate.

term borrowings taken to fund capex investments as well as the lower 
EBITDA. EBIT/Interest at 4.4 closed above the board target of 4.0. 
Current ratio stood at x1.04 (2022: x0.85), meeting our regulatory 
requirement, majorly driven by refinancing of short-term debt as well 
as capex reprioritization. 
The drop in profit was a key driver for the drop on ROCE to 27% (2022: 
41%).

Kwa Ufupi
M
azingira ya uendeshaji wa shughuli zetu yamekuwa 
magumu. Changamoto nyingi za kiuchumi zikiwemo 
mfumko wa bei, kushuka kwa thamani ya sarafu na 
matukio mengine ya kuvurugwa kwa biashara ziliathiri biashara 
yetu. Hasa, tuliathiriwa pakubwa na mfumko wa bei katika gharama 
ya mali ghafi tunayotumia viwandani.
Watumiaji wa bidhaa zetu pia wameathirika. Utafiti unaonyesha 
kiwango cha matumizi ya watumiaji wa bidhaa kwenye Vinywaji 
kwa Jumla (TBA) Afrika Mashariki kimepungua kutoka 7% kabla 
ya janga la Covid hadi 5% mwaka 2023. Wateja pia wamebadilisha 
mtindo wao wa matumizi ya vinywaji kwa kupunguza ni mara 
ngapi wanakunywa, na/au kutumia vinywaji vya hadhi au bei ya 
chini. Kitengo cha bia za kawaida, ambacho huathiriwa sana na bei, 
pamoja na juhudi za kuwa na kitengo kipya cha vinywaji ambazo 
zimeongozwa na nembo ya senator, sana vimeathiriwa na matukio 
haya.
Licha ya changamoto hizi, matokeo ya Kundi yalisalia imara kwa 
kiwango kikubwa, ambapo tuliandikisha faida ya pili kwa ukubwa 
baada ya kutozwa ushuru katika kipindi cha miaka sita iliyopita, na 
tulitimiza malengo yetu katika viashiria vingi muhimu.
Tuliendelea kuufuata mkakati wetu na kuendelea kuwekeza katika 
nembo zetu, kuvumbua bidhaa mpya, na kuwekeza katika njia za 
kumfikia mteja hasa kwa kutumia mageuzi katika dijitali. Tunawekeza 
katika mitambo na mashine kwa ajili ya ukuaji wa kipindi kirefu na 
pia kuiboresha biashara yetu kuhakikisha tunapunguza gharama. 
Tuliendelea pia kuwekeza katika watu wetu, ambao ndio kichocheo 
halisi cha ukuaji, pamoja na kuwekeza pia katika jamii katika maeneo 
tunayohudumu.
Tunajivunia matokeo tuliyoyaandikisha na tuna imani kwamba 
yanaweka msingi wa ukuaji imara siku za usoni kama biashara.
Utathmini wa matokeo
Mauzo halisi hayakubadilika pakubwa ambapo yalikuwa Kshs 109.6 
bn (2022: Kshs 109.4bn) ambapo ukuaji mkubwa katika kitengo cha 
pombe kali ulifutwa na kupungua kwa mauzo katika kitengo cha bia 
Taarifa ya  CFO wa Kundi
ambacho kiliathiriwa na kuongezwa kwa kodi ya bidhaa mara kadha 
mwaka huo. Mapato kutoka kwa uongezaji wa bei na manufaa 
mengine yalififishwa na kushuka kwa jumla ya mauzo, hasa katika 
kitengo cha bia.
Mapato kabla ya kuondoa gharama na kodi (EBIT) yalishuka 14.4% 
ukilinganisha na mwaka uliotangulia na kufikia Kshs 24.2bilioni 
(2022: Kshs 28.3 bilioni) ambapo kiwango cha uwiano cha EBIT 
kulishuka hadi 22.1% (2022: 25.8%). Kuongezwa kwa bei kulichangia 
ongezeko la 8.5% kwenye kipimo cha uwiano cha EBIT, ambapo 
kilifuta kabisa 5.1% ya athari za nyongeza ya kodi hiyo ya bidhaa. 
Hata hivyo, kupungua kwa kiasi cha bidhaa zilizouzwa kuliathiri kwa 
1.9% uwezo wetu wa kufidia gharama zetu zisizobadilika. Mfumko 
wa bei katika gharama ya mali ghafi ya kutumiwa viwandani, hasa 
kwa kilevi kisichoongezwa ladha, nafaka, umeme, mafuta na gilasi 
ilikuwa kubwa ambapo ilifikia Kshs 9.2 bilioni, uliondoa 11.3% 
kwenye kiwango chetu cha uwiano wa EBIT, ambapo tuliweza 
kufidia kwa kiwango fulani kupitia Kshs 4.2 bilioni zilizopatikana 
kupitia uhifadhi wa pesa katika uzalishaji. Hii ilirejesha 4.4% kwenye 
kiwango hicho cha uwiano wa EBIT.  Maboresho mseto kutokana na 
ukuaji wa vinywaji vya bei ya juu kuliwezesha kupatikana kwa 0.5%, 
na uboreshaji wa usimamizi wa matumizi 3.5% jambo lililosaidia 
kufuta athari ya 2.1% ya hasara iliyotokana na ubadilishaji wa sarafu 
(FX) za kigeni. Matokeo yake ni kwamba kiwango chetu cha uwiano 
wa EBIT kilifikia  22.1%.
Gharama halisi za kifedha zilipanda 29.5% na kufikia Kshs 5.4 bilioni, 
hii ikiashiria kuongezeka kwa kiwango cha mikopo yetu ambayo 
sana ilikuwa ya kufadhili matumizi yetu katika mitambo na mashine. 
Lakini pia inaashiria kuongezeka kwenye viwango vya riba sokoni. 
Kiwango chetu halisi cha riba kiliongezeka kiasi kutoka 9.9% hadi 
10.4% ingawa Kiwango cha Riba cha Benki Kuu (CBR) kilipanda 
kutoka  7.5 hadi 10.5%.
Tulishuhudia kuimarika katika kiwango chetu cha kodi ambapo 
kiwango chetu cha wastani cha ulipaji kodi (ETR), kilifikia 34.1% 
ukilinganisha na 35.2% mwaka 2022. 
Faida baada ya ushuru ilifikia Kshs 12.3 bilioni (2022: Kshs 15.6 bn) 
ambapo ni kushuka kwa 20.9%.
Faida inayohusishwa na wenye mtaji ilishuka 16.9% hadi Kshs 9.8 
bilioni (2022: Kshs 11.9 bilioni) ikiashiria kushuka kwa utengenezaji 
faida. Faida inayohusishwa na wenyehisa wadogo (NCI) ilishuka 
33.7% hadi Kshs 2.5 bilioni (2022: Kshs 3.7 bilioni) na kuashiria athari 
za mfumko wa bei hasa katika biashara ya ethanol na pombe kali.

Mapato kwa Kila Hisa
Mapato kwa kila hisa yalishuka 16.9% hadi Kshs 12.47 (2022: Kshs 
15.00), jambo linaloonyesha kushuka kwa utengenezaji faida. 
Wakurugenzi wamependekeza mgawo wa mwisho wa faida wa 
Kshs 1.75 kwa mwaka huu (2022: Kshs 7.25), pendekezo ambalo 
litawasilishwa ili kuidhinishwa na wenyehisa katika Mkutano Mkuu 
wa Kila Mwaka. Tulitangaza mgawo wa faida wa muda wa  Kshs 3.75 
kwa kila hisa (2022: Kshs 3.75) na kwa hivyo jumla ya mgawo wa faida 
kwa mwaka huo ni Kshs 5.5 kwa kila hisa (2022: Kshs 11.00). 
Ingawa sera yetu ya mgawo wa faida imekuwa ni kutoa mgawo 
wa 70% wa mapato baada ya ushuru, kwa kutegemea hali yetu 
ya kifedha, kwa kutegemea kiwango cha viashiria muhimu vya 
kibiashara na pia misukosuko katika mazingira tunayoendeshea 
shughuli zetu, tulionelea ni busara kupunguza malipo ya mgawo wa 
faida ili kupitia kipindi hiki kigumu na kuimarisha hali yetu ya kifedha.
Mizania ya Biashara
Kundi lilifunga mwaka likiwa na kiwango cha uwiano wa mikopo 
halisi na EBITDA cha 1.6, ambacho kipo juu kidogo ya lengo la bodi 
la kiwango cha 1.5 kutokana na kuongezeka kwa mikopo na pia 
kiwango cha chini kidogo cha EBITDA. Tunaamini kwamba tutaweza 
kurejelea lengo la bodi ndani ya mwaka ujao wa kifedha. Kiwango 
cha uwiano wa EBIT na Riba pia kilikuwa 4.4 ambapo ni juu ya 
lengo la bodi la kiwango cha 4.0 kutokana na sababu sawa. Kuhusu 
kiwango cha sasa,  tumefanikiwa kutimiza kiwango cha kisheria cha 
1.0 na nia yetu ni kuendeleza hilo siku sijazo.
Kushuka kwa faida kulichangia pakubwa katika kushuka kwa mapato 
kutoka kwa mtaji uliotumika (ROCE) hadi 27% (2022: 41%).
Ukuaji katika Mtiririko wa Pesa
Pesa taslimu zilizotokana na shughuli zetu zilipungua kidogo hadi 
Kshs 26.1 bilioni (2022: Kshs 26.4 bilioni). Kati ya hizo, Kshs 5.5 bilioni 
zililipwa kama gharama ya riba na Kshs 9.6 bilioni zikawa malipo ya 
kodi ambapo mwaka uliopita zilikuwa Kshs 4.2 bilioni kuhusiana na 
jumla ya kodi ya mwaka wa kifedha wa 2022. Kulikuwa pia na malipo 
ya sehemu ya kodi ya mwaka huu ya  Kshs 5.4 bilioni. Upatikanaji 
huu wa pesa ulitumiwa kuwekeza katika ukuaji wa kipindi kirefu 
kuhusiana na uwekezaji katika mitambo na mashine. Shughuli za 
ufadhili wa kifedha zilizojumuisha ongezeko katika mikopo, ambazo 
zilishushwa na malipo ya mgawo wa faida katika mwaka huo, 
zilichangia ukuaji katika pesa taslimu na visawe vyake kufikia mwisho 
wa mwaka huo hadi Kshs 9.0 bilioni (2022: Kshs 8.1 bilioni).
Kutazama Mbele
Mazingira ya kibiashara yanaendelea kuwa na changamoto. Hata 
hivyo, licha ya changamoto hizi, kuangazia mkakati wetu wa muda 
mrefu pamoja na ukakamavu na mchango wa watu wetu vinatekeleza 
mchango muhimu katika kuiongoza biashara yetu kupitia 
changamoto hizo. Tunaendelea kufuatilia kwa karibu mabadiliko 
katika mahitaji na mitindo ya wateja na kuendelea kuwekeza katika 
bidhaa thabiti ambazo hutupatia ushindani. Tutaendelea kuutumia 
ustadi na weledi katika utekelezaji wa shughuli zetu na katika 
kudhibiti gharama ili kulinda hali ya kifedha ya kampuni.
Biashara yetu ipo katika hali nzuri, na tunachukua hatua zifaazo 
kuhakikisha thamani endelevu na kwa kipindi kirefu kwa wadau wetu 
wote na kuwa na manufaa kwa jamii katika maeneo tunayohudumu.

Bringing Vibrancy and Dynamism to Beer
Beer is at the core of our business and represents a significant opportunity for our entire 
value chain. With our rich heritage and extensive presence across East Africa, we are 
well-positioned to further develop and expand the beer category led by our iconic 
national brands and the global strength of the Guinness trademark.
We have strategically repositioned our beer offerings to cater to a broader audience 
of consumers, encompassing not only the traditional lagers, stouts, and malts but 
also introducing flavoured beer options to appeal to the curious consumer. Drawing 
from consumer insights on the demand for enriching consumer experiences, we have 
strategically aligned our beers with relevant occasions, transforming the traditional 
perception of beer consumption. By pairing our beers with varied occasions, we have 
expanded the range of times when beer can be enjoyed, creating a more versatile and 
inclusive drinking experience.
Our beer consumers have a strong affinity for sports and music. In light of this, we 
actively support and sponsor these cultural spheres with our brands, connecting with 
our audience through their passions.
Our strategy is delivered through four execution priorities:

Within this category, we proudly house iconic national brands such as Kenya Cane, Kane Extra, Chrome, and Uganda Waragi, as well 
as renowned international brands like Black & White and Gilbey’s Gin.
Win in Premium
Consumers are increasingly choosing to trade up and ‘drink better, not more’. They aspire to indulge in brands and categories that embody 
superior quality, authenticity and exquisite taste and have a greater desire to explore new aspirational experiences. Our exciting globally 
leading brands partnered with local jewels across beer and spirits provide accessibility to consumers across the divide allowing them to 
experience premium and luxury brands. This positions us well to drive growth, accelerate, and expand the category.
Within our premium portfolio we feature globally acclaimed brands such as Johnnie Walker, Singleton and Gordon's as well as local 
favourites like WhiteCap, Tusker Lite and Tusker malt.
Shape New Frontiers by Recruiting New Consumers Within Total Beverage Alcohol
Expanding the total beverage alcohol market is a key priority for us, by tapping into new and incremental consumer occasions. 
Our brand, Senator, in Kenya, has played a crucial role by recruiting consumers away from informal alcohol consumption, positively 
impacting society. Furthermore, our significant play in the ready-to-drink category enables us to extend beyond the conventional 
beer and spirits occasions, reaching a wider audience.
We also recognise the growing consumer demand or healthier options and flavours. To meet this need, we have focused on innovation 
in low-alcohol, no-sugar, and flavoured drinks catering to consumers seeking healthier alternatives and enhanced taste experiences.

How We are Responding
Principal Risk
Macroeconomic Environment
Cost of living is an important theme, with high 
inflation in essentials such as food and energy putting 
consumers’ disposable income under pressure. 
However, though affordability remains a key theme, we 
still see premiumisation opportunities as consumers 
seek quality and occasional treats despite budget 
pressure.
We are highly mindful of the need for affordability 
in a period of high inflation. Our extensive portfolio 
across various categories and price points, offers 
consumers a wide range of product choices that 
deliver quality and affordability.
	 Strategy execution
	 Financial risk
Consumer Environment
	Consumers are seeking new experiences: We are 
observing a growing trend among consumers who 
are actively seeking new and diverse experiences. 
	There is also a heightened awareness of the benefits 
of living a healthy lifestyle with an increasing 
preference for lower-alcohol beverages that align 
with their dietary and lifestyle choices.
	Value-seeking: In the current operating environment, 
consumers are prioritising value for their money, 
emphasising cost-effectiveness and quality in their 
purchasing decisions.
	Occasional luxury indulgence: As the number of 
high-net-worth individuals continues to rise, we 
also notice a segment of consumers who desire 
occasional moments of luxury and are willing to treat 
themselves to premium experiences.
Our innovation is driven by deep consumer insights 
into trends and occasions, enabling us to offer a 
diverse range of choices that align with evolving 
consumer attitudes and motivations. 
To enhance vibrancy, we are curating experiences that 
allow our consumers to savour our products and enjoy 
memorable moments at an affordable value.
We have introduced innovative low-alcohol and no-sugar 
brands to cater to the specific needs of this consumer 
segment.
With our extensive portfolio spanning all categories 
along the value chain, we ensure accessibility for 
consumers based on their affordability preferences.
Our premium brands transcend the value chain, 
appealing to aspirational and habitual consumers.
	Consumer disruption
	Increased competition
Illicit Trade
The generalised economic downturn and 
inflationary pressure, has led to resurgence in illicit 
trade (counterfeit, contraband, substandard and 
unregulated products) as consumers move away 
from our brands to alternative products. 
We continue to innovate at scale to provide safe 
and accessible alternatives to our value driven 
consumers. We are also committed to partnering 
with governments across the region in addressing 
the health risks associated with consumption of 
illicit alcohol. 
	 Financial risk
	 Reputational exposure
Sustainability 
There is a growing demand from our stakeholders, 
including consumers, for businesses to showcase 
a positive impact on various aspects of society. 
They seek to align themselves with companies 
that contribute to the betterment of society, 
creating wealth, promoting inclusion and diversity, 
upholding human rights throughout the value chain, 
supporting local communities, and taking tangible 
steps to address crucial societal and environmental 
challenges.
The business, through the Society 2030 vision, is 
focused on driving the right actions to improve 
the environment we operate in. Our plan tackles 
responsible drinking, inclusion and diversity, building 
a sustainable value chain and doing business the right 
way and aligns with the United Nations’ Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). We have designed a 
series of distinct key performance indicators to ensure 
that our progress against Society 2030 is justifiably 
measured, evaluated and reported.
	 Reputational risk
	 Impact of climate 
change
Our strategy allows us to swiftly adapt and respond to shifts in the operating, regulatory and macroeconomic environments as they occur. 
We have observed the emergence of the following trends within our markets, which have implications for our business.

How We are Responding
Principal Risk
Regulatory Environment
The beverage alcohol industry is highly regulated. Excise 
Taxes and VAT on beer and spirits are a key revenue 
stream for Governments and the market has some 
of the highest alcohol excise tax rates in Sub Saharan 
Africa. The industry continues to face excise duty 
pressure as Governments seek to collect additional 
revenues to address budgetary requirements. High 
taxes in turn result in reduced consumer purchasing 
power due to low disposable incomes.
Compliance with law and regulation wherever we 
operate is a minimum requirement. Generally, across 
our markets we play our role in providing evidence-
based tax advocacy, demonstrating the long-term 
impact of excise tax implications on our business, 
value chains and consumers.
	 Financial risk
	 Compliance risk
Digital Revolution
The growing trend towards digitisation continues 
with consumers across the region having become 
very active on digital platforms and much more 
comfortable and familiar with e-commerce. 
Technology has advanced, and  convenience and 
ease-of-use of online shopping have improved. 
We have increased the use of digital tools to improve 
efficiency of operations, customer service and 
marketing spend. 
We are reaching our consumers where they spend 
the most time, increasing our advertising spend in 
digital media. 
Our e-commerce platform ‘’Ke.Thebar.com’’ remains a 
strategic channel and we are continuing to build our 
partnerships with all leading digital platforms to offer 
convenience to the consumer at their fingertips.
Through our digital tools we are also driving 
efficiency in our RTC as we are able to collect real-
time data and analytics that help us drive the right 
action in the shortest time. Our business-to-business 
(b2b) platform, Diageo One, is now deployed in all

Aspirational and Accessible Innovations 
Riding the Sweet and Flavourful Trend
Disrupting and Shaping the Future of Total Beverage Alcohol
Driving sustainable growth across our four 
imperatives, led by consumer insights, lies at 
the heart of our innovation: we use purposeful 
innovation to recruit new consumers to our 
brands and access new occasions in which they 
can be enjoyed.
Our innovation process comes from a deep 
understanding of consumer needs and their 
world, an identification of portfolio gaps, 
continuously scanning the environment 
for emerging trends and clarity on future 
sources of growth for the business. Coming 
off this process we identify the consumer 
opportunity, their unmet needs and the size 
of this opportunity. This process helps us in 
prioritisation and development of a multi-year 
innovation pipeline that not only addresses 
current portfolio gaps but is also future fit.  
This has enabled us to successfully disrupt the 
drinks landscape, expand into new occasions, 
launch brands in culture and ensure sustained 
growth at scale for new launches.
There is a promising potential to tap into a significant consumer segment that seeks alternative 
options. The TBA industry has witnessed notable launches in the form of sweet and flavourful 
propositions With the cohort of consumers avoiding traditional beer for its taste or lack of 
flavour growing steadily, there is an optimistic outlook for these products.  Products such as 
Smirnoff Pineapple Punch, Rockshore Tropical, and Gordon’s premixes have gained attention 
and success, appealing to young and female consumers who prefer more dynamic and 
sessionable flavours. These products differentiated themselves through unique taste offerings, 
premium positioning, and attractive packaging.

Accelerated investments behind 
digitalisation and technology continue 
to be a key enabler of our growth and 
business transformation
We are on an accelerated growth to deliver 
digital transformation with people at the core 
to drive the change. Our digital transformation 
ambition is to leverage our people, unified data 
and technology at scale to build our competitive 
edge across our value chain and transform 
access to our brands for our consumers and with 
our customers to deliver value with efficiency 
and scale. 
New digital tools are improving operational 
productivity and helping us serve customers 
in a  more cost-effective way with better 
monitoring of insights and data. We continued 
to drive a range of technology solutions for 
digital transformation across different areas 
of the business during the year, including 
manufacturing, marketing. and our route to 
consumer, increasing our capabilities focusing 
on customer and consumer centricity, employee 
experience as well as operational productivity. 
Leading the way in RTC solutions
We continued our efforts behind a technology 
enabled route to consumer by further 
embedding our business analytics tools ‘Every 
Day Great Execution’ (EDGE 365) and ‘Distributor 
Management 
System’ 
(DMS), 
to 
support 
distributors on stock and sales management, 
and sales force automation. Advanced analytics 
from ‘Diageo One’, our b2b self-service portal 
has enabled generation of outlet-specific orders 
and improved the order-taking process and 
outlet execution unlocking previous barriers to 
servicing customers efficiently.
Connecting with Consumers Through Digital
Further within our digital agenda, we are making 
significant strides in digital commerce. In the year, 
we continued to invest in and develop our digital 
commerce platforms and solutions catering to 
the growing numbers of consumers choosing 
to shop online. This is generating incremental 
revenues for our business, while providing 
invaluable consumer data and insights that 
continue to inform our strategy.
Building Digital Transformation Capability 
with Our People
We have accelerated systematic efforts to raise 
digital capabilities in our core business teams 
ensuring that digital transformation of our business 
model is keeping pace with the evolution of our 
market and competitive landscape. Digital talent 
is high in demand and short in supply- skills are 
niche, expensive, and constantly evolving. At EABL, 
we are putting significant investment behind 
digital as a key growth enabler and are investing 
in growing our internal digital talent pipeline 
through upskilling programmes.
In 2023, we launched a digital capability programme 
dubbed ‘Digital Now’ which is our company-wide 
digital capability programme designed to level-set 
digital awareness and knowledge for all employees 
and enable more advanced skills acquisition. This 
talent development programme enables employees 
to successfully adapt to the digital landscape and 
contribute effectively to our digital initiatives and future.
Our Digital Capability vision for ‘Digital Now’ 
is everyone in EABL has the relevant digital 
knowledge, skills, mindset, and behaviours to 
accelerate our ability to engage with consumers, 
unlocking next generation celebrations and 
driving incremental growth.

Evolving our Route to Consumer (RTC) 
in line with the changing consumer and 
shopper trends
We continuously review our RTC and make 
necessary changes and adoptions to reach 
our consumers and shoppers across all 
consumption occasions. One of the key 
environmental changes since Covid-19 is the 
growing significance of the home occasion 
that offers consumption opportunities off-
premise. Consumers and shoppers are seeking 
convenience. Therefore, our ability to deliver to 
our consumers when and where they need our 
brands is more than ever important. Over the 
year, we reached key milestones in making our 
RTC agile to optimise these opportunities.
Revamped Gold Standard 
At the beginning of the financial year, we 
revamped and relaunched our Distributor 
Management playbook, Gold Standard Journey, 
which prescribes standards and guidelines 
for running a world-class distributorship. The 
Gold Standard Journey seeks to guarantee 
a community of capable and sustainable 
distribution partners. 
The standard is based on 5 Pillars: 
(1)	 Commercial – that encompasses world-
class 
sales 
execution 
standards 
and 
performance management routines to 
guarantee consistent business growth 
(2)	 Finance – right funding structure and 
guidelines on optimum Working Capital 
Management
(3)	 Supply-best-in-class warehousing standards 
(4)	 A fit-for-purpose organisation structure with 
the right people and capabilities 
(5)	 Use of data and insights from our Distributor 
Management System for decision-making
Our sales team works with our distribution 
partners to embed these standards and 
practices, which are independently audited and 
upon which certified Gold customers unlock a 
set of incentives. Since the relaunch, we have 
seen growth in the number of distributors 
certified Gold. By the end of the year, 20 of our 
distributors had achieved the coveted Gold 
Standard while 35 had been certified silver 
status moving towards Gold status.

eB2B Acceleration:
Advancements in technology continue to offer retailers options 
to engage with suppliers any time they need information and 
product delivery to guarantee all-round product availability to 
their customers. In today’s fast-paced business environment, 
organisations across various industries are constantly seeking 
ways to optimise their operations and gain a competitive edge. 
eB2B has emerged as a powerful solution to streamline and 
expedite the exchange of business information and transactions 
between partners, suppliers, and customers, that enables 
retailers to place their orders through their preferred distributors 
and receive timely information, products, promotion campaigns 
and product offers for delivery at their preferred time.
We have made significant strides by digitising ordering for 
our retailers through Diageo One, a world-class, Diageo-
owned platform enabling eB2B retail self-serve, which has 
revolutionised the way we engage with our trade partners at 
the point of purchase. 
Our key objective for Diageo One is to drive a performance and 
culture shift enabling sustainable value growth for our business 
and our RTC partners through the digitalisation of RTC. The 
platform offers significant benefits for the distributors by allowing 
them to increase revenues, reduce cost to serve and defend 
market share against disruption. By offering a 24/7 available 
platform, Diageo One can make it easier for customers to run 
their business, improve profitability, and grow further.

How we determine our material issues
Society 2030: Spirit 
of 
Progress
A snapshot of our progress against 
our sustainability strategy: Society 
2030
We firmly believe that a focus on 
sustainability is the right thing to do, 
integral to our culture of “bold, progressive, 
connected” and a central enabler of our 
continued success. Our work around 
governance, environment and societal 
issues is equally as important as our 
financial performance. 
In 2021, we published our inaugural 
Sustainability Report, following our year-
long 
materiality 
assessment 
process. 
In 2022, we published a follow up 
Sustainability Report detailing progress 
against our strategic objectives and casting 
a wider net to incorporate the activities 
that we are undertaking to ensure that 
sustainability is well embedded across the 
entire organisation. 
As an organisation, sustainability reporting 
is part of our critical operational functions, 
and we look forward to further cultivating 
and documenting our journey. 
Materiality at EABL
We adopted the GRI definition of 
materiality and conducted our own 
intensive materiality assessment process 
between 2020-2021 to determine the 
Environmental, Social and Governance 
issues that matter most to our business 
and to our stakeholders. The materiality 
assessment looked at external trends 
shaping EABL’s operating environment in 
the region and how we can most effectively 
align EABL’s work with the UN Sustainable 
Development 
Goals. 
We 
interviewed 
many internal and external stakeholders, 
analysing their interests and concerns as 
well as the risks and opportunities for EABL 
to ensure that our sustainability work is 
focused on achieving the greatest impact 
and tackling the issues that matter most. 
Data for our comprehensive materiality 
analysis process was collected using 
a 
series 
of 
participative, 
qualitative 
and 
quantitative 
methods, 
including 
questionnaires, 
one-on-one 
interviews 
and focus group discussions. We applied 
a snowballing sampling technique, to 
support our stakeholder mapping exercise, 
and identify additional stakeholders across 
our value chain.
We view materiality as a participative process; a 
business tool that facilitates integrated thinking.

We want to change the way the world 
drinks for the better.
We will do this by celebrating moderation 
and continuing to address the harmful use 
of alcohol, expanding our programmes that 
tackle underage drinking, drink driving and 
binge drinking.
Water is the basis of life and our 
most precious resource.
By 2030, every drink we make will use 
30% less water than today and by 2026, 
we will replenish more water than we 
use in all our water-stressed areas.
We all have a responsibility to restore 
the natural world on which life depends.
We will do our bit by eliminating waste from 
our value chain, collaborating with farmers 
to regenerate landscapes and creating 
innovative solutions to grow sustainably.
We believe doing business the 
right way contributes to a fair and 
just society.
We will create an environment where all our 
people feel they are treated fairly and with 
respect. We will act with integrity to ensure we 
are doing business in the right way, meeting 
external expectations and our standards.
The planet needs significant 
science-based action to create a 
sustainable low-carbon future.
We will decarbonise our own 
operations by 2030 and work with our 
suppliers to halve theirs by 2030 too.
We believe the most inclusive and 
diverse culture makes for a better 
business and a better world.
We will champion inclusion and diversity 
across our business , with our partners and 
communities, to celebrate diversity and 
help shape a tolerant society.
We are commited to preserving 
the natural resources on which we 
all depend.
We will work in partnership to tackle 
climate change, water stress and 
biodiversity loss, and help create a 
more sustainable world.
In 2022, we further refined our materiality assessment to include the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) Mandatory Disclosures. 
The detailed results of our materiality assessment and the management approach and evaluation of our additional material topics are 
contained in our 2022 sustainability report. 
We report against our sustainability strategy, Society 2030: Spirit of Progress, our 
10-year sustainability action plan to help create a more inclusive and sustainable 
world. Society 2030: Spirit of Progress reflects the most material issues affecting our 
company, our people, our brands, our suppliers and our communities.
Our plan includes 25 ambitious targets aligned to the United Nations’ Sustainable 
Development Goals, grouped under the themes shown below.

Promote Positive Drinking
Responsible Marketing:
Promoting positive drinking is central to our ‘Society 2030: Spirit 
of Progress’ plan. As a responsible company, EABL wants to make 
a significant and sustainable impact on creating a more positive 
role for alcohol in society and making responsible drinking a 
valued, enjoyable part of life. We are proud of our brands and 
know the best way to enjoy them is in moderation. 
Our Diageo Marketing Code (DMC) and Digital Code set 
mandatory minimum standards for responsible marketing. 
These are reviewed every two years. At the heart of DMC is our 
commitment to ensuring all our activities depict and encourage 
only responsible and moderate drinking, and never target those 
who are underage.
Promote Positive Drinking:
SMASHED, our initiative aimed at creating awareness on the perils 
of underage drinking, has significantly surpassed our annual 
targets, reaching 289,542 students in Kenya with messages 
on the dangers of underage drinking. We worked closely with 
partners such as the Ministry of Education, the Teachers Service 
Commission, and various secondary schools across the country 
to be able to achieve this. 
In Tanzania, where the prevalence of underage drinking is a 
growing public health concern SMASHED reached a total of 
16,086 students across 18 schools in Dar es Salaam and Tanga. Our 
results were enabled through strong partnerships including, the 
Bridge for Change Organisation, Temeke Municipal Council, Tanga 
Municipal Council, Ubungo Municipal Council and The Ministry of 
Education. We used live theatre performances to educate students 
on the dangers of underage alcohol consumption in a creative, 
and relatable way.  The programme’s interactive approach engages 
students and makes them more receptive to the message. The 
impact of the programme can be demonstrated through pre-
We want to change the way the world drinks for the better. That means 
promoting moderation and continuing to address the harmful use of alcohol

and post-surveys, which showed an average increase of 12% in 
students’ awareness of how to stay safe. 
In Uganda we partnered with the Topowa Youth Mentoring 
Uganda to introduce the SMASHED Live programme in February 
2022. SMASHED has been taken to over 50 schools and still aims 
at reaching many more teenagers in other schools. 
Through the "Wrong Side of the Road" campaign, we continued to 
sustain and develop our partnership with the National Transport 
and Safety Authority (NTSA) to educate and sensitise road users 
on responsible drinking in order to enhance road safety in Kenya. 
In Uganda we worked with influencers during the festive season 
to push out the messaging around the campaign due to the 
many accidents registered during the festive season. In Tanzania 
we also leveraged the festive season and partnered with the 
country’s traffic police authorities to create more awareness and 
sensitisation on the perils of drink-driving.
We have also been on the forefront in driving awareness on the 
perils of illicit alcohol within the region. In Kenya, we have actively 
engaged and partnered with the Government at National and 
County Levels to create awareness, to the public, on the dangers 
of illicit alcohol consumption. Through these engagements, 
awareness sessions were run in various counties in Central and 
Eastern Kenya, as well as in Nairobi. We have also supported 
capacity building for enforcement officers in identifying and 
curbing illicit alcohol. 
In Uganda, in partnership with the Private Sector Foundation 
Uganda (PSFU), we held a dialogue aimed at curbing illicit trade. 
The dialogue also aimed at putting in place ways of engaging 
various government entities and the private sector to counter 
illicit trade in Uganda.
Together with other adult beverage manufacturers under 
Uganda Alcohol Industry Association (UAIA), we unveiled the 
Responsible Code of Business Conduct 2023. The code intends 
to ease collective engagements with government agencies on 
issues of mutual interests, honesty, and truth in the way formal 
players in the alcoholic beverages sector produce and market 
their different products.

Champion Inclusion and Diversity
We believe that the most inclusive and diverse culture makes for 
a better business and a better world. We have been passionate 
about changing the narrative around the underrepresentation of 
youth, women and people living with disabilities in employment 
and supply chains across our business and have made 
empowering them a business priority.
We are progressing with efforts to ensure that our operations 
are inclusive spaces for persons with disabilities (PWDs). In July 
last year, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in 
We champion Inclusion and Diversity across our business: from the way we 
attract, develop, retain and recruit the very best talent, to the way we source 
services and progressively portray diversity through our brands. We are 
determined to remove barriers, while having a positive impact on our partners, 
suppliers and communities.

Kenya with Inclusive Futures partner, Sightsavers, that’s geared 
towards mainstreaming the inclusion of persons with disabilities 
into the business. The five-year programme will impact more 
than 705 farmers with disabilities across eight sub-counties 
in western Kenya and later one county in eastern Kenya. This 
follows a successful pilot programme in Homa Bay County where 
we onboarded farmers with disabilities into the sorghum value 
chain. Working with Sightsavers, we equipped 71 farmers with 
disabilities with the skills and resources to grow and supply 
sorghum for use in the production of Senator Keg beer. 
Our business in Tanzania has 
long been recognised nationally 
for 
our 
transformational 
work to champion inclusion 
and diversity. This year SBL 
partnered with the Ministry of 
Agriculture and the Foundation 
for Disability Hope to empower 
over 100 persons with disabilities 
through 
agricultural 
and 
business training in Dodoma. 
50% of the participants were 
women, who are historically 
excluded

training programme, equipped PWDs who are currently engaged 
in agricultural activities with knowledge and skills to engage in 
agri-business activities, entrepreneurial skills and become self-
reliant. The training was conducted by experienced agriculture 
experts from the Sokoine University of Agriculture who provided 
participants with practical skills. The training was viewed by the 
participants as a step towards addressing the challenges faced 
by people with disabilities in accessing economic opportunities. 
The programme also received support from the government, 
which emphasised the need for inclusive development and the 
promotion of economic empowerment for marginalised groups. 
As a result of the programme, SBL has planned to source our raw 
materials from the PWDs trained, which will, ultimately, boost 
their income and raise their standard of living. 
In Uganda, we have formulated a recruitment policy to ensure 
that 10% of all new hires are persons with disabilities. We believe 
that this will create a workplace and a company culture that is 
respectful and inclusive towards persons with disabilities and will 
promote the hiring, retention, and professional development of 
persons with disabilities. 
Women face unique barriers as a result of structural inequity, and 
we sought to reduce the resultant income gaps that put women 
at a greater risk of poverty. In March this year, we partnered 
with CARE International Kenya (CIK) to launch a Community 
Engagement toolkit for women’s equal participation in Water, 
Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH). The toolkit will be used by EABL 
employees as well as their WASH delivery partners working on 
designing and implementing community WASH programmes. 
In Uganda, we partnered with the office of the Luzira Women 
Councillor LC III in March 2023 to offer agribusiness training and 
donate 2,000 mushroom gardens to Luzira single mothers. We 
also worked closely with the Mayuge Health Centre and donated 
a universal anaesthesia machine with a monitor, vaporiser, and 
ventilator. This donation is part of the corporate society of safe 
motherhood campaign, implemented by UBL Spirited Women, 
which seeks to support and build awareness for maternal health, 
providing hospital equipment to select health facilities and 
donating ‘Mama kits’, for expectant women, for the welfare of 
mothers in underserved hospitals. 
To promote youth inclusion in economic growth activities, 
as part of our Inclusion and Diversity pillar, SBL partnered 
with the Ministries of Education and Agriculture on our award 
winning - Kilimo Viwanda Scholarship Programme. The running 
scholarship programme targets needy high-potential students 
coming from agricultural communities across Tanzania. This 
year, the programme awarded 75 students pursuing Diploma 
level Agricultural Courses with financial support. Further, the 
programme also offers a package of other benefits to students 
including:
-	 Field attachments at SBL to give learners practical exposure to

temperature rises of approximately 0.7 degrees centigrade. 
With the predictions that temperatures will rise further, the 
continent is facing a wider range of effects, including increased 
droughts and floods. In the near future climate change will 
contribute to decreased food production, floods and inundation 
of the continent’s coastal zones and deltas, changes in natural 
ecosystems and loss of biodiversity, as well as the spread of 
waterborne diseases and the risk of malaria. 
Cognisant of these effects, as EABL 
we continue to advance our business 
practices in order to more responsibly 
source, produce, distribute and sell our 
products with sustainability at the top of 
our minds. We prioritise fighting climate 
change with the resources we have and 
the knowledge we continue to build 
knowing that doing so will help millions 
of stakeholders across our supply chain. 
 
 
Water for Life
As part of our commitment to Grain 
to Glass Sustainability, we are moving 
towards 100% replenishment of the 
water we use in water-stressed areas. 
Through our ‘Water for Life’ programme, 
we provide access to clean and safe 
water for communities across the 
East African region. In Kenya, we have 
completed over 75 water projects in the 
last decade, which are benefiting over 
2.5 million people across the country. 
We launched a water project in Ndiguini 
Kikuyu Constituency, Kiambu County, in 
March this year that is benefiting over 
5,000 people. The borehole yields 5,400 
We have always understood that for our business to be sustainable, it needs to 
create enduring value – for us and for those around us. Our ‘Society 2030: Spirit 
of Progress’ ambitions take us further than ever in our drive to preserve water 
for life, accelerate to a low carbon world and become sustainable by design.

litres of water every hour, which is enough drinking water for about 
2,700 people per day. The water project was sponsored by the 
EABL Foundation with a contribution of Ksh 8.4 million, that was 
utilised for mapping, drilling, equipping a 330m deep borehole, 
and the construction of an elevated steel-pressed water tank. 
Our ‘Water for Life’ initiative in Tanzania has since 2010 invested 
over Kshs 85 million on 24 boreholes and other forms of water 
projects around the country to provide safe and clean water 
to impoverished rural communities. This year, we injected an 
additional Kshs 20 million towards the renovation and construction 
of the Kwamizi water dam in Handeni District, Tanga region. The

We recently hosted the EABL Agri Forum that brought together 
over 100 stakeholders from the private sector, government, 
academia and NGOs to discuss pertinent issues around 
sustainable agriculture in the region. Through the forum, we 
were able to foster meaningful discussions around regenerative 
agriculture and the level of support farmers need to mitigate and 
adapt to the effects of climate change.
We have concluded the successful pilot of Project Rudisha, 
through which, we aim to run a sustainable glass collection 
spirits business, shifting 100% from one way to a returnable glass 
model. Rudisha will help us reduce our scope 3 emissions / value 
chain emissions, which form the majority of the businesses total 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
Other benefits include, reduced water and energy consumption, 
reduced cost of business and reduced contribution to landfill. 
Additionally, the project will provide jobs to youth who will 
collect, wash, sort, and return the glass bottles to EABL.
project which is being implemented in partnership with Water Aid 
and the local government, commenced on Feb 28, 2023, and is 
expected to be completed in April 2024, with a capacity to hold 
137,376 cubic metres of water and provide clean water to 12,000 
men, women and children of Handeni district. Upon completion 
of the Kwamizi water project, we are already working on engaging 
the local community in Handeni to start Sorghum farming and sell 
it to SBL at competitive prices to help empower the farmers and 
spur economic development in the area.
In Uganda we also continued to support local communities in 
providing support for water and sanitation services. UBL provided 
20 hand pump boreholes worth Kshs 20 million to communities 
in the Northern and North-Eastern sub-regions of Teso and 
Lango. These boreholes will serve over 9,000 people across the 
districts of Oyam, Lira, Kapelebyong, Katakwi, and Bukedea. This 
project demonstrates tremendous progress towards aiding the 
government in prioritising the development of the nation’s 
human capital under the National Development Plan III, which 
seeks to increase access to safe water supply from 70% to 85% in 
rural areas and from 74% to 100% in urban areas. 
We also handed over a kitchen facility to traders in the Portbell 
shopping centre and a modern ablution block for residents 
of Kamwanyi village in Luzira. The ablution block is serving 
approximately 2,000 people in the Kamwanyi community while 
the kitchen has a capacity of 24 stoves, 24 cabinets, and 24 
concrete slabs. The ablution facility is improving access to water 
and sanitation for residents of Kamwanyi, and contains toilets 
with water supply, a hand washing area as well as a bathroom 
that the community members will readily access round the clock. 
. The facility has also considered persons with disabilities and 
includes user-friendly rooms for men and women. 
UBL is also supporting the national Running Out of Trees campaign 
(ROOTs) which seeks to plant a total of 40 million trees in a period of 
5 years. ROOTs brings together different players in the private sector 
who have joined hands to plant trees across Uganda with the aim 
of replenishing the forest cover that has been lost due to various 
human activities. A group of UBL staff went to Nakaseke district and 
planted 5,000 trees as part of their 2022 contribution to the Running 
Out of Trees (ROOTs) campaign that was launched in 2020. 
Sustainable by Design
Through our Business Partner programme, we provide the 
necessary logistics to accelerate our suppliers’ journey towards 
zero carbon by partnering with them on circular design, 
sustainable farming, and more. Our local sourcing programme 
is a crucial business priority for us because it enables us to grow 
value together with the farmers in East Africa. We take pride in 
a network of 62,000 farmers from whom we source 80% of our 
sorghum and barley.

Business Integrity
Compliance with our Code of Business Conduct and conducting 
our business with integrity are non-negotiable, and our 
approach to risk and compliance helps us go beyond the basics 
to encourage the right behaviours and attitudes every day, 
everywhere.
The COBC is our minimum standards and at the heart of it is a 
culture of acting with personal integrity at all times as we engage 
with internal and external stakeholders. The COBC is applicable to 
all employees, directors, and business partners of the Company. 
Annual mandatory training is delivered to all Diageo employees 
and contractors in an easily accessible e-learning format, with 
classroom training delivered to those  employees who do not 
have regular access to a computer. Regular training, awareness 
and communication programmes as well as compliance 
monitoring mechanisms are in place to ensure that all relevant 
stakeholders remain aware of and continue to comply with the 
provisions of our COBC and policies. 
In addition to being the best-performing consumer products company, we are 
equally committed to our ambition to become the most trusted and respected 
business in East Africa. We are committed to conducting business with integrity 
from grain to glass, with respect to how we deal with our people, third parties, 
government and all our stakeholders. 
Doing Business The 
Right 
Way
Human Rights
Everyone who works at EABL is a custodian of our trusted 
reputation. As part of the 2020 targets for societal impact, 
we made an external commitment to conduct Human 
Rights Impact Assessments in our markets in order to 
identify potential risks in our value chain and develop 
action plans to mitigate against those risks. These 
assessments identified three external risks as particularly 
salient to our business: labor rights, including the risk of 
child labour; labour standards for contract workers and 
sexual harassment in the hospitality sector. We have 
responded to these risks in a number of ways, including 
awareness programmes focused on child protection 
in agricultural supply networks, commissioning an 
independent study into contracted labour, and developing 
our Brand Promoter Standard and training aimed at 
protecting brand promotion teams from harassment.

Policies and Codes of Conduct
Our COBC covers salient themes which include Health, Safety 
and Personal Security, Bribery and Corruption, Responsible 
Drinking, Money Laundering, Discrimination and Human Rights, 
Information Management and Security, Quality, Insider trading, 
Conflict of Interest, Competition and Antitrust, Data Privacy, 
Relationships with customers, suppliers and other business 
partners, External Communications, and social media amongst 
others. Fairness, integrity and transparency are the principles

For many years, we have sustained continuous engagements with 
our people (contractors and employees) in building understanding 
of our Code, Policies and Corporate Governance principles and 
to further embed our ethical standards in their daily activities. 
This way, we expect that they will choose to do the right thing 
everyday and everywhere and we insist on this as a prerequisite for

Anti-bribery and corruption:
EABL will not condone, under any conditions, the 
offering or receiving of bribes in any form, including 
what are known as 'facilitating payments' or other 
improper payments. Our principle is never to 
engage in bribery and our anti-bribery framework is 
designed to prevent, detect and respond to bribery 
and corruption threats. Through our Know Your 
Business Partner (KYBP) Standard we assess all our 
business partners for potential economic sanctions 
and compliance risks such as bribery and corruption, 
money laundering, facilitation of tax evasion, data 
privacy or other reputational red flags. We carry out 
additional due diligence processes for those parties 
that pose a potentially higher risk. This year, we 
refreshed our anti-bribery and corruption policy and 
reissued it as the Global Countering Corruption Policy, 
which merged the Anti -Bribery and Corruption and 
Anti- Money Laundering policies into one.
An effective SpeakUp (whistleblowing) framework
We have a SpeakUp policy that encourages our employees, and 
anyone we do business with, to raise concerns about potential 
breaches of our Code of Business Conduct or policies. Our confidential 
and independently managed whistleblowing helpline, SpeakUp, 
is available via phone or web portal, enabling anyone in or beyond 
EABL to report a concern. Additionally, we encourage employees 
to come forward to their line manager; their legal or HR partners; risk 
and compliance teams; or business integrity partners. 
Our approach to breach management is embedded in the Diageo 
Breach Management Standard and our local Disciplinary Policy. 
All allegations are taken seriously and those that require action are 
investigated and addressed promptly. We monitor breaches to identify 
trends or common areas where further action may be required, and 
learnings are used to further educate our people.
The Board Audit and Risk Committee receives and reviews regular 
reports on unethical concern allegations raised by employees and 
third parties, including trends information and investigation closure 
rates, and a report is given at Board meetings. A total of 41 concerns 
were raised in F23. Of the 41 concerns, 28 were unsubstantiated and 
13 were substantiated, and disciplinary action taken accordingly.

Our Approach
A
t EABL risk management is an integral part of doing business, supported by a clear governance framework. Risks are an essential 
element when opportunities are assessed, and strategies are set. A proactive approach ensures risk management is part of our 
executive conversations and is embedded in our processes. Our primary focus is to identify and embed mitigating actions for material 
risks that could impact our current or future performance, and/or our reputation. 
Our risk management efforts aim to be holistic and integrated, bringing together risk management, internal controls and business integrity, 
ensuring that our activities across this agenda focus on the risks that could have the greatest impact.
Risk Management Framework
We have embedded a robust risk management framework and practice as central to good management, with the Board taking overall 
responsibility for managing risk. The Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent of the principal risks that the Company is 
willing to take to achieve its strategic objectives and for maintaining sound risk management and internal control systems. 
Below is our risk management framework:
Managing Risk
On an annual basis, we undertake a holistic risk mapping and 
assessment to identify top internal and external existing or 
emerging material risks including financial, operational, strategic 
and compliance and regulatory. Information on prevailing trends is 
provided in relation to each risk and all identified risks are assessed 
at five levels (negligible/low/moderate/high/critical) by reference to 
their impact to the business and likelihood of occurring. 
These risks are assigned to specific owners who are then tasked with 
ensuring that robust plans are in place to mitigate these risks or 
prevent them from crystallising. These risks and mitigation plans are 
reviewed on a quarterly basis at the Risk Management Committee 
(RMC) meeting which is chaired by the Managing Director and 
comprise the heads of functions and other extended leadership 
team members. The risk registers are reviewed on a quarterly basis 
and at each Board Audit and Risk Committee meeting.
Identify:
Deep dive to identify our top risks 
Continuous review:
Review of what is going on around 
us and ensuring we have the right 
plans in place
Monitor and report:
Insightful reporting
Assess
Assess the likelihood and impact 
of risks to drive effective, prioritised 
mitigations 
Mitigate:
Develop and embed 
mitigation actions
Internal Controls
We have continued to sustain a strong internal controls programme 
through our Controls Assurance and Risk Management (CARM) 
framework, which also ensures EABL complies with all relevant local 
and international legislations. Our internal controls aim to provide 
reasonable assurance as to the accuracy of financial information, non-
financial disclosures, the Company’s compliance with applicable laws 
and internal policies, and the effectiveness of internal processes. Internal 
controls have been defined at operating entity level and at process level 
for key processes, including financial reporting, IT and Tax.
Effective implementation of controls is assessed periodically and 
deviations from the defined standards are included in a monitoring 
and follow-up processes, supporting management in addressing 
these deviations. Management is responsible for the definition and 
timely implementation of action plans to remediate any deficiency 
identified as part of these assessments. The results are reported to 
the Board Audit and Risk Committee.

Principal Risk: Slowed economic growth, macroeconomic volatility and impact of geo-political tensions
Key Drivers
Mitigation
The economy continues to experience 
slowed business activities, increased levels 
of unemployment and inflation resulting in 
reduced consumer purchasing power and 
financial loss. During the year we experienced 
forex liquidity and volatility resulting from the 
global recession. Inflationary pressures are 
broadly expected to continue in the short term 
but then start to ease over the medium term.

Principal Risk: Supply chain disruptions and impact of climate change 
Key Drivers
Mitigation
Supply chain constraints and disruptions in raw, 
packaging and other auxiliary materials due to 
global geo-political tensions (Russia-Ukraine 
war), climate change and overreliance on single 
suppliers. Supply chain disruption is likely to 
grow in the near term, rather than stabilising. 
Geopolitical tensions, oil and gas prices, 
ongoing conflict in Ukraine and higher inflation 
will have an adverse impact on logistics, and 
material volatility, amidst broader supply chain 
impacts. Unpredictable weather patterns will 
result in increased volatility in the supply of raw 
materials, production costs, capacity constraints 
and higher costs of compliance.
Link to Strategic Imperative/Enabler:
•	 Supply footprint
•	 Efficient Growth/ Productivity
•	 Ongoing geopolitical tensions, 
including Russia/Ukraine crisis
•	 Continuing supply chain volatility
•	 Supply/demand imbalances and/or 
crop yields
•	  Geo-political crisis and effects oil 
prices flowing through to increased 
raw material costs
•	 Impact of climate change over the 
longer term
Risk Outlook
•	 We have applied more detailed and 
robust planning processes throughout

Principal Risk: Illicit Trade 
Key Drivers
Mitigation
With the adverse economic factors, we have 
seen growth in demand for illicit (counterfeit, 
contraband, substandard and unregulated 
products) and infringement of IP (intellectual 
property) as consumers seek cheaper options.

•	 Vibrant beer
•	 Explode mainstream spirits
•	 Win in premium
•	 Shape new frontiers
•	 Innovation
•	 Challenging economic conditions
•	 Unemployment and 
underemployment rates
•	 Pricing pressure
Risk Outlook
•	 Anti-counterfeiting measures 
embedded in our packaging to deter 
reuse, making our products more 
difficult to copy and enabling rapid 
authentication. 
•	 We operate an active programme 
to identify high-risk areas, engage 
with customs and law enforcement 
authorities and participate in industry 
initiatives to monitor and prevent 
counterfeiting activity. 
•	 We run an online monitoring and 
takedown programme across high-
risk e-commerce and social media 
platforms, and undertake direct 
engagement with many platforms to 
create awareness and stop counterfeit 
listings.

Principal Risk: Cyber Threats
Key Drivers
Mitigation
Sophisticated cyber and IT threats, including 
those facilitated through breaches of internal 
policies and unauthorised access, could lead 
to theft, loss and misappropriation of critical 
assets and/or personal data and disruption 
to core business operations including 
manufacturing and supply, resulting in financial 
loss, significant fines and reputational damage.  
Cyber-attacks are becoming more prevalent, 
and we are increasingly dependent on third-
party IT services and solutions. Geopolitical 
tensions are growing, and there is a rise in 
more sophisticated cyber threats affecting all 
organisations, therefore the risk of a cyber-attack 
remains heightened.
Link to Strategic Imperative/Enabler:
Digital transformation
•	 Increasing use of cloud based 
technologies and working from home

Principal Risk: Consumer Disruption
Key Drivers
Mitigation
Consumer tastes and trends around socialisation 
are continuing to evolve as the world continues 
to emerge from a period of extreme disruption 
that has reshaped consumerism temporarily 
and residually. Slower than desired response 
to a rapidly changing consumer landscape 
would lead to suboptimal execution and loss 
of share. Inability to respond and adapt our 
products or AP investment to disruptive market 
forces — including but not limited to digital 
technology, health and lifestyle priorities, altered 
consumption behaviour, new drivers of choice, 
and new formats and technologies — could 
adversely impact our ability to effectively 
service our customers and consumers with the 
required agility, leading to slow execution, poor 
commercial decision-making and loss of share.

•	 Vibrant beer
•	 Explode mainstream spirits
•	 Win in premium
•	 Shape new frontiers

players with varying business models
Risk Outlook
           
•	 We have a highly diversified portfolio 
of brands to ensure coverage of 
consumer occasions, trends and price 
points.
•	 Accelerated development of the 
e-commerce and off-trade channels.
•	 We perform a systematic review of 
emerging consumer and route-to-
consumer trends at market and brand 
level, including growth of disruptive 
digital technologies.
•	 We focus our innovation on our 
strategic priorities and the biggest 
consumer opportunities, through 
global brand extensions and new-to-

•	 Our Demand Radar system provides 
enhanced demand forecasting 
capability at market and category 
level, allowing us to optimise

EABL strives to be the most trusted and best 
performing 
organisation 
that 
consistently 
supplies high quality products to the East 
African market and beyond. This is achieved 
through customer-centric and progressive 
strategic plans anchored on partnering with 
our communities to enhance local sourcing, 
implementing initiatives that enable sustainable 
manufacturing and distribution, as well as 
programmes focused on people to drive 
employee productivity, inclusion and diversity.
The success in delivery by the supply operations 
is anchored on the key pillars of health and safety, 
sustainability, quality and cost effectiveness, 
underpinned by the value we have for our people.
Health and Safety
Our focus on commitment to safeguarding the 
health, safety and well-being of our employees 
is unwavering. Our refreshed safety clarion call 
‘safer together, at work, on the road and at home’ 
underscores this commitment. This approach is 
geared towards ensuring that all our employees, 
business partners and visitors are safe all the 
time.
EABL achieves health, safety and welfare of 
its stakeholders through compliance to all 
applicable occupational health and safety 
legislations and the global risk management 
standards.
To bring the above commitment to life, we have 
embarked on the following improvements:
	On-site traffic safety enhancement through 
segregation of vehicle and pedestrian paths. 
	Hazardous energies controls improvement 
targeting upgrade of our equipment and 
employee capability.
	Continued partnership with our transporters 
to improve road safety through audits and 
embedding safety controls in our contracts.
	Implementation of Diageo Life Saving Rules 
programme which is critical in mitigating all 
kinds of severe and fatal potential accidents.
	Mental health awareness sessions across the 
business as well as a continued physical health 
checks programme.

several interventions to ensure our teams stay primed to not only 
meet current customer needs but also future business demand 
including the below:
	Professionalisation of brewing and packaging where we have 
enrolled our teams to the renowned Institute of Brewing and 
Distilling (IBD).
	Embedding quality fundamentals through quality assurance 
training.
	Good to great coaching (G2G) for all heads of departments 
ensuring quality people development.
	Data level 1 awareness to address timeliness and quality of data 
captured across the supply chain.
Sustainability
EABL supply chain is fully alive to our Society 2030 agenda and the 
call to action for the Spirit of Progress. To drive the grain to grass 
sustainability agenda, EABL has made significant strides in its key 
performance indicators of water, energy, waste to landfill, water 
replenishment and carbon reduction, all with an agenda of reducing 
the environmental impact from our supply operations.
State of the art water recovery plants are operational across our 
sites in Nairobi, Kisumu and Uganda and have been instrumental in 
reducing our net water usage. Recycled and reused water volume 
in our production process in the last one year totalled 398,264m³ 
representing 14% of our total withdrawals. 
EABL has significantly reduced its carbon footprint by installing and 
commissioning biomass boilers in our production sites in Nairobi 
and Kisumu. As a result, our carbon emissions reduced by 55% this 
year to 28,134 tonnes. This has also seen renewable energy use 
across our sites increase to 65% this year. 
Quality
We have continued to drive quality improvement across all three 
sites by focusing on the following areas:
	Embedding quality at source across our brewing and packaging 
operations to drive a higher level of ownership at shop floor level.
	Implementation of a comprehensive governance process that 
includes the creation, review, and enforcement of quality gates 
from grain to glass to ensure that every step of the production 
process is closely monitored and controlled to guarantee that the 
final product meets the highest standards of quality.
	On time execution of critical-to-quality engineering routines.
	Compliance to the codified brewing and packaging process 
through the Codex and DWB programmes.
	Integrating quality performance in all operational routines.
Focusing on these pillars, EABL supply chain consistently delivers 
high-quality products that exceed our customers’ expectations.
Recognition
EABL supply continues to be celebrated locally and globally. The 
EABL Supply Team was recognised for initiatives undertaken on 
sustainability that aim to reduce environmental impacts from energy 
and water usage. EABL won the following awards at the 2022 edition 
of Energy Management Awards (EMA): 
	Overall Water Management Award – KBL
	1st runners up Sustained High Performance – Nairobi Site
	1st runners up Electrical Energy Savings Award – Nairobi Site
	1st runners up Water Management Award
In the Monde selection awards EABL brands won 4 golds (for Tusker 
Lager, WhiteCap Crisp, WhiteCap Lager and Balozi Lager) and 2 silvers 
(for Tusker Malt Lager and Tusker Lite Lager).

Optimising our business operations and 
improving efficiencies to drive cost savings 
remains a strategic priority. We have built a 
more resilient and agile operation through 
process rationalisation, leveraging innovative 
technologies, and fostering a culture of 
continuous improvement. 
Our procurement function has been actively 
engaged 
in 
strategic 
sourcing, 
supplier 
relationship management, and cost control 
measures. Through industry-wide benchmarking 
and renegotiated contracts, we have secured 
competitive pricing and achieved significant cost 
reductions in raw materials and components. 
Continuous improvement of our manufacturing 
processes through the adoption of lean 
methodologies and leveraging automation 
technologies has eliminated waste, minimised 
downtime, and reduced operational costs.  
In our logistics operations, we have focused 
on optimising transportation routes and 
improving 
inventory 
management. 
By 
leveraging advanced technologies and data-
driven insights, we have successfully reduced 
transportation costs and minimised delays. 
Additionally, 
streamlining 
our 
warehouse 
management processes has reduced holding 
costs and eliminated inefficiencies in inventory 
management.
These 
focused 
efforts 
in 
procurement, 
manufacturing and logistics, have realised 
tangible benefits that have partly mitigated 
the impact of significant input cost inflation. In 
the financial year 2023, we achieved savings of 
Kshs 4.2 billion, partially offsetting the impact of 
cost inflation amounting to Kshs 12.2 billion and 
mitigating the adverse effect on gross margin.

We remain committed to continuous improvement and leveraging innovative solutions to enhance operational 
efficiencies and deliver productivity savings, enabling us to sustain profitability.

Employee Engagement
Commitment to Our People’s Well-being
Our employee well-being continues to be our utmost priority. We 
have created an environment and culture where all our people can 
thrive at work and at home. With our culture top of mind, we have 
embraced flexible working and continued to drive mental, physical, 
financial and social well-being amongst our employees. Our well-
being philosophy makes well-being part of our everyday culture. 
We have continued to update our policies so that they reflect this 
approach. 
Following on the 2022 launch of our Domestic and Family Abuse 
Guidelines outlining our zero-tolerance approach for all forms of 
domestic and family abuse, and practical guidance for where to 
get confidential support, this year we launched the Pregnancy 
Loss Guidelines. The guidelines create awareness on various types 
of pregnancy loss including resources available to employees and 
line managers of those who may experience this loss. The guidelines 
recognise that pregnancy loss is a bereavement. We recognise that 
experiencing pregnancy loss is a grieving process that requires 
patience and time. When pregnancy loss occurs before 20 weeks an 
employee or spouse can access up to 10 working days of paid leave 
and after 20 weeks the carrying female can access up to 26 weeks 
while the spouse can access up to to 10 working days of paid leave.
People Welfare and Rewards 
The welfare of our people remains a critical part of our growth 
agenda. We focus on financial rewards and non-financial rewards, 
together, forming our employer value proposition. 
Our well-being philosophy works together with other progressive 
policies and competitive reward guidelines including: 
•	 Quarterly and annual rewards including annual salary reviews, 
performance rewards, spot recognition, functional recognition, 
company-wide recognition and long-service policy and 
guidelines. 
•	 A mortgage benefit scheme, partly funded by EABL, in 
consideration that one of the highest priorities for our employees 
is the ability to own a home and this aspiration is an integral part 
of their financial plans. 
•	 A comprehensive employee’s medical scheme and wellness 
programme to ensure a healthy workforce across our business. 
•	 A clinic fully resourced to provide general and specialist medical 
care to employees and their families. EABL Kenya also has E-Health 
which is an online medical platform that allows employees to 
access medical care remotely. 
•	 Collective bargaining agreement that spells out the benefits, 
working conditions and applicable labour relations with the 
unionisable employees as mutually agreed.
•	 An employee share ownership plan (ESOP) connecting 
employment to the long-term success of our business. The plan 
forms a crucial part of employee engagement, retention and 
commitment to creating sustainable value for our people and 
our business. 
Each year we conduct an anonymous employee engagement 
survey (Your Voice), exploring how company values are 
being demonstrated individually and across the company. 
The survey reinforces how much pride and positivity we 
feel about EABL’s culture and how well we are connected to 
deliver our performance ambition. This year our employee 
engagement index improved to 90% (+1 vs 2022) with 91% 
of respondents to our ‘’Your Voice’’ employee survey citing 
that they are proud to work for EABL and would recommend 
EABL as a great place to work.

us and ties in with United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 5 
on empowering women and girls. To this end, we have put in place 
measures and frameworks to ensure that we align our business to 
meet this target. Currently, we are at 35% gender diversity across 
EABL with an ambition to achieve 50% gender representation across 
the business by 2030.

Corporate Governance Statement
Organise operational, 
financial, risk management, 
and reporting processes 
such that the Board receives 
the information it requires 
to effect good governance 
and management, and the 
business units can conduct 
their activities in ways that 
comply with regulations and 
serve strategic ends.
Bring the organisation’s 
governance framework 
down to the roles, 
responsibilities, reporting 
lines, and communications 
level to bridge the gap 
between the governance 
framework and operational 
realities.
Sustain governance by 
creating a feedback loop 
in which the Board and 
Management can identify 
and respond to new 
business, operational, 
competitive, and regulatory 
needs.
OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
EABL is committed to implementing and adhering to good corporate governance and best practice. We have put in place a corporate 
governance structure which assists in attaining the following objectives:
EABL operates within a clearly defined governance framework which provides for delegated authority and clear lines of responsibility without 
abdicating the responsibility of the Board. Through the framework, the Board sets out the strategic direction of the Company while entrusting 
the day-to-day running of the organisation to the executive management led by the Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer. 
The Board operates through four committees mandated to review specific areas and assist the Board in undertaking its duties effectively and 
efficiently. Details of the committees are provided in various sections of this report.
Statement of responsibilities
The Directors are committed to fulfilling their fiduciary responsibilities and have instituted various principles necessary to ensure that good 
governance is practised with respect to dealings with the Company’s shareholders, customers and other relevant stakeholders in line with 
the spirit of the CMA Code of Corporate Governance for Listed Companies.
Integrated Report & Financial Statements 2023

The Board is committed to ensuring that a strong governance 
framework operates throughout the Group, recognising that good 
corporate governance is a vital component to support management 
in its delivery of the Company’s strategic objectives and to operate 
a sustainable business for the benefit of all stakeholders. The Board 
recognises that identifying, developing and maintaining high 
standards of corporate governance suitable for the Company is 
ongoing and dynamic to reflect changes in the Company and 
its business, the composition of the Board and developments in 
corporate governance.
The Board of Directors is responsible for the governance of the 
Company. The Board applies good governance practices to promote 
strategic decision-making for the organisation to balance short, 
medium and long-term outcomes to reconcile the interests of the 
Company together with its stakeholders and the society to create 
sustainable shared value. To that end, sound governance practices 
based on accountability, transparency, ethical management and 
fairness are entrenched across the business. 
The Companies Act 2015 requires Directors to act in good faith 
to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its 
stakeholders and to avoid conflict between their personal interests 
and those of the Company, always acting in the company’s best 
interest. Directors have a statutory duty to promote the success of 
the Company for the benefit of its stakeholders. In promoting the 
success of the Company, Directors must have due regard to the 
long-term consequences of their decisions, the legitimate interests 
of employees, the need to foster effective business relationships with 
suppliers, customers and various stakeholders, the impact of the 
Company’s operations on the community and the environment, and 
the desire to maintain a reputation for high standards of business 
conduct.
The Board ensures that high standards and practices in Corporate 
Governance, more specifically, the principles, practices and 
recommendations set out under the Code of Corporate Governance 
Practices for Issuers of Securities to the Public, 2015 (“the CMA 
Code”), as well as the Companies Act, 2015 (“the Act”), are adhered 
to. EABL continues to endeavour to comply with the provisions of 
the CMA Code. Over and above the annual self-assessment that the 
Company is expected to complete on its level of compliance with 
the Code, the Corporate Governance Statement, as provided in this 
Annual Report, will highlight to the Company’s shareholders and 
various stakeholders the performance to date.
EABL remains committed to the highest standards of corporate 
governance and business ethics. Good corporate governance practices 
are essential to the delivery of long-term and sustainable stakeholder 
and shareholder value. The Company also adheres to other regulations 
promulgated by the CMA, the Nairobi Securities Exchange and the 
ethical standards prescribed in the Company Code of Conduct. In 
addition, as a law-abiding corporate citizen, EABL abides by the tenets 
of the Constitution of Kenya and all other laws.
The Board is collectively accountable to the Company’s shareholders 
for the long-term success of the Company and its overall strategic 
direction, values and governance. It provides the leadership 
necessary for the organisation to meet its business objectives within 
the framework of its internal controls while also discharging the 
Company’s obligations to its shareholders. The Board has delegated 
responsibility for implementing strategy and day-to-day operations 
to the Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer and the 
Company’s executive team. 
Throughout the year ended June 30, 2023, and to the date of this

Board Size
The Board determines its size and composition, subject to the 
Company’s Articles of Association, Board Charter, relevant policies, 
applicable law and best practices. The constitution of the Company’s 
Board, as stipulated by the Company’s Articles of Association, 
provides that the number of Directors shall not be less than five and 
not more than 11. The Board currently comprises 11 Directors, nine 
Non-Executive Directors, and two Executive Directors. Six of the nine 
Non-Executive Directors are Independent Non-Executive Directors 
as defined in the Code.
The Board is of the view that its current size is sufficient and enables 
it to deliver on its mandate.
Board Appointment 
Succession planning is an ongoing process, with the Board 
discussing the same regularly. As part of its mandate, the Board 
Nominations and Remuneration (BNRC) is responsible for selecting 
and appointing Board Directors. Prior to any appointment, the BNRC 
develops suitable selection criteria for potential candidates, screens 
and interviews them before they are formally appointed. The BNRC 
is permitted by its terms of reference to engage the services of a 
qualified external consultant to identify prospective candidates for 
the role of Independent Director.
Proposed candidates for the role of Independent Director undergo 
a formal screening process conducted by the Nominations and 
Remuneration Committee of the Board before they are formally 
appointed by the Board. New Directors are issued with letters 
of appointment with clear terms and conditions regarding the 
discharge of their duties.
In between Annual General Meetings (AGMs), in the event of any vacancy, 
the Board may appoint a Director to serve until the next AGM. Any such 
appointment of an Independent Director is brought to the attention of 
the shareholders through the notice of the AGM and the Director. If they 
opt to seek re-election, they are subjected to an election process by the 
shareholders at the next AGM following their appointment, subject to 
continued satisfactory performance and commitment.
The Articles of Association also provide that at every AGM, and as 
may be applicable, at least one-third of the directors (excluding 
executive directors) must retire from the Board and, where eligible, 
and if they choose to, stand for re-election. 
The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for 
an initial term of three (3) years. Letters of appointment are 
renewable after the initial three (3) years as per the Board’s policy 
on tenure and upon recommendation by the Nominations and 
Remuneration Committee. The Board considers the need to refresh 
its membership progressively over time.
Non-Executive Directors 
As of this report’s date, the Board had nine Non-Executive Directors. 
The Non-Executive Directors come from broad industry and 
professional backgrounds, with varied experience and expertise 
aligned to the needs of the business. 
The Non-Executive Directors help develop strategy and ensure 
the proposed business strategies are fully discussed and critically 
reviewed. This enables the directors to promote the success of the 
Company for the benefit of its shareholders, considering, among 
other matters, the interests of employees and fostering business 
relationships with customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. 
The Non-Executive Directors oversee the operational performance 
of the business, scrutinise the performance of Management and 
the Company, bring an external perspective to the Board, monitor 
reporting of performance and should be available to meet with 
major stakeholders as appropriate. To perform these tasks, they have 
full access to all relevant information, with updates on governance, 
regulatory and other matters affecting the Company.
Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the 
Company but instead have letters of appointment which stipulate 
the terms of their appointment.
Independent Directors and Independence 
The Board recognises the importance of independent judgement 
and constructive engagement on all matters brought before the 
Board for deliberation. Directors’ views should have regard to the 
best interest of the organisation and its stakeholders. 
As of the date of this Report, the Chairman and five of the Non-
Executive Directors are independent as defined by the CMA Code, 
and accordingly, one-third of the Board comprises Independent 
Directors (over half the Board is comprised of Independent Non-
Executive Directors). 
The Board undertakes an annual assessment of Directors’ 
independence based on the independence criteria outlined in the 
CMA Code.

Board operations
The Board meets at least four times a year, and the meetings are 
structured to allow for open discussions. Comprehensive Board 
papers are prepared and circulated to all Directors for all substantive 
agenda items prior to the meeting. This allows time for the Directors 
to undertake an appropriate review of the Board papers to facilitate 
full and effective discussions at the meetings. The submissions and 
notification period may be waived should any urgent and critical 
matters arise prior to the date of the meeting. Where Directors are 
unable to attend a meeting, they are advised on the matters to be 
discussed and given the opportunity to make their views known to 
the Chairman or the Group Managing Director prior to the meeting. 
This process also applies to the Committee meetings. 
The members of the Executive Team may be invited to attend the 
Board and/or Committee meetings if deemed necessary – and 
appropriate – to make presentations on their areas of responsibility. 
This serves as an opportunity to give the Directors greater insights 
into their business areas. 
Annual Board Work Plan
The Board is solely responsible for its agenda. It is, however, the 
responsibility of the Chairman and the Company Secretary, working 
closely with the Group Managing Director and Chief Executive 
Officer, to come up with the annual Board work plan and the agenda 
for the Board meetings. The Board has an annual work plan that sets 
out the Board activities in a year. The work plan is designed to enable 
the Board to drive the strategy forward. The Board work plan for the 
year ended June 30, 2023, was approved by the Board at its meeting 
held on July 27, 2022.

Board Effectiveness
The effectiveness of the Board in its oversight and leadership role is 
enhanced by a robust support system. This is facilitated through the 
following:
Board Diversity
The Board recognises and embraces the benefits of diversity and 
views increasing diversity as an essential element in maintaining 
a competitive advantage. The Board also recognises the role of 
diversity in bringing different perspectives into Board debates and 
offers better anticipation of the risks inherent in the business and the 
opportunities that the business pursues. 
The Company seeks to have a Board with the right mix of individuals 
with relevant attributes, skills, knowledge and experience and who 
jointly have the overall collective competence to deal with current 
and emerging issues and effectively guide Management in ensuring 
the highest performance for the Company. The Non-Executive 
Directors are expected to have a clear understanding of the strategy 
of the Company and knowledge of the industry in which the 
Company operates. The aggregate mix of skills and experience of 
the Directors seeks to challenge Management, ensure robust and 
constructive debate, augment and challenge the strategic thinking 
of the executives, thereby adding value to the Company.
The Board regularly reviews the skills, knowledge and experience 
represented on the Board against the skills and experience needed 
to deliver the strategy. The Board continues to make efforts to 
diversify the skillset and gender. The Nominations and Remuneration 
Committee has been tasked to take this into consideration in its 
nominations.
Integrated Report & Financial Statements 2023
118
The Company’s Non-Executive Directors come from broad industry 
and professional backgrounds, with varied experience and expertise 
aligned to the needs of the business. The areas of expertise of the 
current Board of Directors include business management, banking, 
finance, 
corporate 
communications, 
economics, 
marketing, 
project management, risk management, capital markets, legal and 
governance and information technology.
OUR BUSINESS | OUR PERFORMANCE | STRATEGIC REVIEW | CORPORATE GOVERNANCE | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Committees undertake deep dive sessions on the various markets 
to gain deeper insights. The Board and its Committees also receive 
regular briefings on legal and regulatory developments that affect 
the business. 
In December 2022, the Board held its annual corporate governance 
training session and its annual strategy session for two days, whereby 
an update on the Strategy was presented. To better understand the 
business, the Board also had deep dive sessions on the business with 
a focus on consumer dynamics, innovation, people and culture and 
ESG – Society 2030. The Board also held deep dive sessions in the 
year under review on the Continuity and Resiliency Plan pre and after 
the General Elections. To better appreciate the whisky production 
process, the Board visited Scotland for a market visit in May/June 
2023 and held a deep dive into Scotch whisky.
In the year under review, each of the Directors who served for the 
full year secured at least 12 hours of training from the Company as 
prescribed by the CMA Code of Corporate Governance Practices for 
Issuers of Securities to the Public 2015.
Access to Independent Advice 
The Board recognises that there may be occasions when one or 
more Directors consider it necessary to take Independent Advice on 
various matters, such as legal or financial advice, at the Company’s 
expense. This is provided for in the Board Charter and the Terms of 
Reference of each Committee.
Management of Conflicts of Interest
The Directors are obligated to fully disclose to the Board any real or 
potential conflict of interest which comes to any Director’s attention, 
whether direct or indirect. The statutory duty to avoid situations in 
which the Directors have, or may have, interests that conflict with 
those of the Company has been observed by the Board in the 
financial year under review. All business transactions with all parties, 
Directors or their related parties are carried out at arm’s length. An 
acknowledgement that, should it come to the attention of a Director 
that a matter concerning the Company may result in a conflict of 
interest, obligates the Director to declare the same and exclude 
himself/herself from any discussion or decision over the matter in 
question. 
The Board has formal procedures for managing conflicts of interest 
in accordance with the Companies Act 2015 and the CMA Code of 
Corporate Governance Practices for Issuers of Securities to the Public. 
Directors are required to give advance notice of any conflict issues 
to the Chairman or Company Secretary, which are considered at the 
next Board meeting. 
Declaration of conflicts of interest is also a standard agenda item 
addressed at the onset of each Board and Committee meeting. 
The Board also requires all Directors to disclose, on appointment 
and annually, any circumstance which may give rise to an actual or 
potential conflict of interest with their roles as Directors. 
Directors are excluded from the quorum and vote in respect of any 
matters in which they have an interest. No material conflicts were 
reported by Directors in the year under review.
Legal and Compliance Audit 
In compliance with the CMA Code of Corporate Governance Practices 
for Issuers of Securities to the Public, 2015, an external consultant 
carried out a Legal and Compliance Audit for the year ending June 
30, 2023, specific to EABL’s employment-related practices and 
Male 
64%
Female 
36%
Short biographies of the Directors, including details of their 
nationalities, relevant skills and experience, are set out on page 106 
to 109.
Induction of Directors
On joining the Board, all Directors receive a full induction. Non-
Executive Directors also receive a full programme of briefings on 
all areas of the Company’s business from Executive Directors, the 
Company Secretary and other senior executives. The induction 
provides an overview of the Company, the Company’s operating 
environment and new developments thereof, accounting and 
financial reporting developments, as well as any regulatory changes. 
The induction programme includes a series of meetings with other 
Directors, the Chief Executive Officer and senior executives to enable 
new Directors to familiarise themselves with the business. The three 
new Directors appointed in the year under review are in the process 
of being inducted.
Directors’ Training and Development 
The Board is committed to ongoing training and development of its 
Directors, and towards that goal, appropriate training interventions 
were identified during the year for attendance by Directors. To 
enable the Non-Executive Directors to gain exposure to the Group’s 
business on the ground, when possible, one of the four scheduled 
Board meetings is held in the end markets, where Directors get an 
opportunity to undertake various trade visits, engage the sales team 
and outlet owners on market-related issues. The Board and

policies. The audit covered EABL, Kenya Breweries Limited, UDV 
(Kenya) Limited and East African Maltings Limited. The audit aimed 
to assess compliance with applicable employment-related laws, 
regulations and national standards in line with the scope of the Legal 
Audit Report.
The Auditor opined that the Group had a high level of compliance 
with all applicable employment laws, regulations and national 
standards. Any issues flagged in the Legal Audit Report were easily 
rectifiable. Implementation of recommendations from the external 
Legal and Compliance Audit conducted is ongoing. 
Governance Audit 
The CMA Code provides that issuers of securities to the public 
are required to undertake periodic governance audits. Following 
extensive stakeholder consultation to consider the frequency, cycle, 
cost and scope of governance audits, the Capital Markets Authority 
(CMA) advised all issuers of a revision in the cycle of governance 
audits to at least once every two years with the option of CMA 
increasing or decreasing this frequency on a risk-based approach.
The Company undertook a governance audit for the financial 
year ending June 30, 2022, conducted by Dorion Associates LLP, 
who issued an unqualified report. The Governance Audit Report 
was adopted by the Board of Directors on May 30, 2023. The audit 
confirmed that the Board has put in place a sound governance 
framework that complies with the legal and regulatory framework 
and is in line with global best governance practices for the interest 
of stakeholders. The Board and various Committees continue to 
implement the recommendations from the governance audit. The 
next governance audit will be undertaken for the financial year 
ending June 30, 2024.
Board Evaluation 
The effectiveness of the Board, its Committees, the Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors, the Chairman, and the Company Secretary 
is reviewed annually. The Board evaluation for the year under review 
is currently ongoing and will be conducted internally based on 
parameters agreed on by the Board. The evaluation aims to assess 
how the Board has performed in its oversight role over the period 
under review and identify opportunities for improvement in its 
structures and processes to improve its effectiveness.
Corporate Governance Assessment Report 
During 2022, the Capital Markets Authority assessed the CMA Code’s 
implementation status by the Company for the year ended March 
31, 2022. The assessment was based on a review of commitment 
to good corporate governance; board operations and control; 
rights of shareholders; stakeholder relations; ethics and social 
responsibility; accountability, risk management and internal control; 
and transparency and disclosure. 
The overall rating awarded to the Company was a leadership 
rating of 82% – a testament to the Board’s commitment to sound 
corporate governance practices. The Company continues to 
implement the recommendations received from the CMA to 
improve its implementation under the CMA Code.
Directors’ Shareholding
Directors can purchase or sell shares of the Company in the open 
market. As at the end of the financial year under review, none of 
the Directors held shares in their individual capacity of more than 
1% of the Company’s total equity. The breakdown of the Directors’ 
personal shareholding in the Company as of June 30, 2023, is as 
follows:

The Board Committees, Composition and their Activities

the Company’s current choice of external auditor. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) were the Group’s auditors during the financial year. They have since issued a written confirmation to the Board 
of their intention to seek re-appointment as the Company’s auditors at the Annual General Meeting, subject to approval by the Shareholders.

Board Policies
The Board has established policy and procedure documents to 
guide the Directors and Management in implementing their roles 
and responsibilities. A summary of the governance documents and 
their key provisions are listed below:
Communication with Stakeholders 
EABL is committed to ensuring regular interaction and communication 
with its stakeholders, including shareholders, investors the financial 
markets, among others. The Board has mapped all its stakeholders 
and ensures they receive full and timely information about the 
Company’s performance. This is achieved by releasing the half-year 
and annual results in the local press, distributing annual reports 
and holding investor briefings as appropriate. The Annual General 
Meeting provides a useful opportunity for shareholder engagement, 
particularly for the Chairman to articulate the Company’s progress 
and receive and answer questions from investors. The Board believes 
there is an active and regular interaction with all its stakeholders. In 
addition to information on the Company’s activities, the following 
documents and policies are readily available to stakeholders on the 
Company’s website: The Board Charter; Board Committees Terms of 
Reference; Past and current copies of the Annual Reports; Investor 
News; and Share Price performance – Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.
Engagement with Shareholders
The Board seeks to engage with shareholders to maintain a mutual 
understanding of objectives between them and the Company and 
manage their expectations. The Executive Directors manage relations 
with shareholders and potential investors, who are contactable 
directly and via the Shares Registrar.  
EABL remains committed to relating openly with its shareholders by 
providing regular and ad hoc information on operating and financial 
performance and addressing any areas of concern. This is achieved 
through the following: 
•	 Interim and annual results and publication of extracts of its financial 
performance in the daily newspapers, preparation of annual 
audited accounts and holding of the Annual General Meeting. 
•	 Copies of the annual reports are made available to shareholders 
at least 21 days before the date of the AGM, and they are free to 
raise questions to the Board during the meeting. 
•	 Investor briefing sessions are held immediately after the interim 
and full-year results are announced. 
•	 The Executive Directors make regular presentations to 
investors (both existing and potential shareholders), meet with 
shareholders to discuss long-term issues and obtain their views, 
present at externally run investor events and communicate 
regularly during the year.  
•	 The Company’s website has a specific web page dedicated to the 
information requirements of the shareholders and investment 
analysts. 
•	 The Board of Directors encourages shareholder participation 
at the Company’s annual shareholder meetings. The Board, 
including the Chairs of the Committees, are available at the 
Company’s AGMs to answer questions from shareholders.
•	 The Company also retains an external Shares Registrar who 
provides feedback from existing shareholders and potential 
investors.  During the year, the Company changes Share Registrars 
from Custody and Registrar Services to Image Registrars Limited.
Conflict of Interest Policy 
•	 Directors are obligated to fully disclose to the Board 
any real or potential conflicts of interest which come 
to their attention, whether direct or indirect. 
•	 All business transactions with all parties, Directors, or 
their related parties, are carried out at arm’s length.
Whistleblowing Policy
•	 The policy outlines mechanisms that facilitate 
anonymous reporting and anti ethical behaviour by all 
stakeholders.
•	 The ethics hotline is managed by an independent, 
accredited and extenal institution.
Insider Trading Policy
•	 The policy is used to institute structures to prevent 
insider dealings by Directors and Management. 
Through this, the Company endeavours to preserve 
the confidentiality of unpublished, price-sensitive 
information and prevent misuse of such information.
Anti-bribery Policy and Anti-fraud and Corruption
•	 This policy prevents employees and agents from 
giving or receiving bribes (directly or indirectly) and 
attempts to induce favours by way of bribes.
•	 We review compliance with regulatory obligations, 
particularly those surrounding fraud, corruption and 
anti-money laundering.
Board Remuneration Policy
•	 This policy sets out the guidelines and criteria for the 
compensation of the Independent Non-Executive 
Directors.
Operational Policies
•	 There are broad operational policies that guide 
Management in execution of the Group's operations in 
an efficient manner.

Stakeholders and Social Responsibilities
The Group’s business model relies heavily on developing and 
maintaining strong relationships with staff, clients and regulatory 
authorities. The Board is conscious of its responsibility towards all 
stakeholders and believes this is an important consideration for 
the long-term growth of the business.    Stakeholder engagement 
and feedback is taken seriously throughout the Group. Regular 
communication is made around the Group companies and internal 
staff. The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its 
internal staff and keeps them informed on matters affecting them 
as employees and the various factors affecting the performance of 
the Group. This is achieved through formal and informal meetings 
and information on the Company’s website and workplace.   The 
Group uses social media to engage directly with stakeholders 
through various channels, including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. 
The Group also directly engages with regulators and Government 
agencies through membership in worldwide trade associations.
Going Concern
The Board confirms the financial statements are prepared on a 
going concern basis and is satisfied that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. In 
making this assessment, the Directors consider a wide range of 
information relating to present and anticipated future conditions, 
including future projections of profitability, cash flows, capital and 
other resources.

Integrated Report & Financial Statements 2023

The Directors submit their report together with the audited financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2023, which disclose the state 
of affairs of East African Breweries Plc (“EABL” or the “Company”) together with its subsidiaries (together the “Group”). The annual report and 
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the 
Kenyan Companies Act 2015.
1.	 Principal activities
The Company and the Group are involved in the marketing, importation, production, and distribution of a collection of brands that range 
from beer and spirits to adult non-alcoholic drinks across six markets within which we operate in East Africa, especially concentrated in the 
three core markets of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. 
2.	 Business review
i)	 Financial performance
The Group generated net sales of Kshs 109.6 billion (2022: Kshs 109.4 billion). While revenues remained stable, volumes declined by 7% 
reflecting the impact of the economic downturn and high inflation across the region on consumer disposable incomes. The imposition of 
higher excise tax rates during the year, particularly in Kenya, further affected the consumption of our brands.
Profit after tax of Kshs 12.3 billion is 20.9% below profit 2022 of Kshs 15.6 billion. The decline was primarily driven by higher costs due to the 
impact of inflation and currency devaluation on our cost base, partly offset through price increases and cost management initiatives.  
ii)	Environment, Social and Governance
Society 2030: Spirit of Progress is our ten-year action plan to manage our most material ESG matters. This action plan streamlines our ESG 
goals into four key pillars namely: (i) Promoting positive drinking, (ii) Championing inclusion and diversity, (iii) Pioneering grain to glass 
sustainability through water preservation, becoming sustainable by design, accelerating to a low carbon world, and (iv) doing business the 
right way.
We continued to embed Society 2030 into our business practices, ensuring that our growth is responsible, inclusive, and respectful of the 
communities we operate in. 
iii)	Our people
Our people and culture are key enablers in delivering our performance ambition. We are committed to offering an environment where our 
staff can thrive by providing the right opportunities and experiences for development and progression. 
Our Bold, Progressive and Connected culture is fueling empowered teams, fostering an innovative spirit and driving proactive collaboration, 
enabling our teams to do their best work. We have taken steps to simplify ways of working and to improve the efficiency of processes, with 
the goal of empowering our people by enabling more agility and speed in execution. 
We are equally dedicated to the health, safety, and wellness of our people and have set up policies and frameworks that support their well-
being.
iv) Related party transactions
The Directors confirm that they have disclosed the Group and Company-related party transactions in these financial statements and there 
were no insider dealings for the year ended 30 June 2023.
3.	 Dividends
Directors recommend that the Board approves the proposal to declare final dividend of Kshs 1.75 per share (2022: Kshs 7.25 per share) 
amounting to Kshs 1.384 billion (2022: Kshs 5.734 billion). An interim dividend of Kshs 3.75 per share for 2023 (2022: Kshs 3.75 per share) was 
paid in April 2023. The total dividend pay-out for the year will therefore be Kshs 5.5 per share (2022: Kshs 11 per share) amounting to Kshs 
4,349 billion (2022: Kshs 8.699 billion).
4.	 Directors
The Directors who held office during the year and to the date of this report are set out on page 128.

Wakurugenzi wanawasilisha ripoti yao pamoja na taarifa za kifedha zilizokaguliwa za mwaka uliokamilika 30 Juni 2023, ambazo zinaonyesha 
hali ya East African Breweries Plc (“EABL” au “Kampuni”) pamoja na kampuni zake tanzu (kwa pamoja “Kundi”). Ripoti ya kila mwaka na taarifa 
za kifedha zimeandaliwa kwa mujibu wa maelezo kwenye Sheria ya Kampuni Kenya ya 2015.
1.	Shughuli kuu
Kampuni hii na Kundi zinajihusisha katika mauzo, uagizaji, uzalishaji na usambazaji wa mkusanyiko wa nembo za bidhaa ambazo ni kuanzia 
bi ana pombe kali hadi kwa vinywaji vya watu wazima visivyo na kilevi, katika mataifa sita ambayo tunahudumu Afrika Mashariki, ambapo 
shughuli zimekolea zaidi katika masoko matatu makuu ambayo ni Kenya, Uganda, na Tanzania.
2.	Utathmini wa biashara
i) Matokeo ya kifedha
Kundi lilipata mauzo halisi ya Kshs 109.6 bilioni (2022: Kshs 109.4 bilioni). Ingawa mapato hayakubadilika sana, kiasi kilichouzwa kilishuka kwa 
7% jambo ambalo linaashiria athari za kudorora kwa uchumi na mfumko wa bei kote katika kanda kwenye matumizi ya pesa za hiari kwa 
wateja. Kuanza kutozwa kwa kodi ya juu ya bidhaa katika mwaka huo, hasa nchini Kenya, kuliathiri pia ununuzi na matumizi ya bidhaa zetu.
Faida baada ya kutozwa kodi ya Kshs 12.3 bilioni ambayo ilipatikana mwaka huo ni 20.9% chini ya faida ya mwaka 2022 ya Kshs 15.6 bilioni. 
Kushuka huku sana kulitokana na ongezeko la gharama lililotokana na athari za mfumko wa bei na kushuka thamani kwa sarafu kwenye 
gharama zetu. Athari hizo kwa kiwango fulani  zilifutwa kupitia ongezeko la bei za bidhaa zetu na mikakati ya kudhibiti gharama.
ii) Mazingira, Jamii na Utawala
Jamii 2030: Moyo wa Maendeleo ni mkakati wetu wa miaka kumi wa kuongoza masuala yetu yanayohusu ESG.
Mpango huo unalainisha malengo yetu ya ESG katika nguzo nne kuu ambazo ni: (i) Kuhamasisha unywaji pombe wa kuwajibika, (ii) Kutetea 
thamani ya tofauti zetu na kujumuisha wote, (iii) Kutekeleza uendelevu wa kuanzia kwa nafaka hadi kwenye gilasi kupitia uhifadhi wa maji, 
kuwa na muundo wa uendelevu, na kuongeza kasi ya kuhakikisha kuwepo kwa ulimwengu usiozalisha gesi ya mkaa (iv) kufanya biashara 
kwa njia sahihi.
Tuliendelea kufungamanisha mpango huo wa Jamii 2030 kwenye shughuli zetu za kibiashara, kwa kuhakikisha ukuaji wetu ni wa kuwajibika, 
unajumuisha wote, na unaheshimu jamii katika maeneo tunayohudumu.
iii) Watu wetu
Watu wetu na utamaduni wetu ni viwezeshi muhimu sana katika kutimiza ndoto zetu za ukuaji. Tumejitolea kuhakikisha kuwepo kwa 
mazingira ambapo wafanyakazi wetu wanaweza kunawiri kwa kuwapa fursa zifaazo na uzoefu kuwawezesha kujikuza na kupiga hatua.
Utamaduni wetu Jasiri, wa Kisasa na wa Kuunganisha unachochea makundi ya wafanyakazi waliowezeshwa, na pia kukuza moyo wa ubunifu 
na uvumbuzi. Aidha, unasaidia ushirikiano na kuwezesha makundi yetu ya wafanyakazi kufanya kazi zao kwa njia bora Zaidi. Tumechukua 
hatua kurahisisha njia za kufanya kazi na pia kuboresha shughuli na taratibu za kufanya kazi. Lengo ni kuwawezesha watu wetu kwa kuhakikisha 
wepesi na kasi ya kuchukua hatua na kufanya kazi.
Pia tumejitolea kwa njia sawa kuangazia afya, usalama na maslahi mengine ya watu wetu na tumeweka sera na mifumo ya kuwasaidia katika 
kuwawezesha kuwa na hali njema na afya bora.
iv) Shughuli za kibiashara za uhusiano
Wakurugenzi wanathibitisha kwamba wameweka wazi shughuli zao za kibiashara ambazo zinaweza kuwa zinahusiana na Kundi na Kampuni 
katika taarifa hizi za kifedha na kwamba hakukuwepo na shughuli za kibiashara zenye mgongano wa maslahi kwa mwaka uliomalizika 30 
Juni 2023.

East African Breweries Plc (“EABL” or “Company”) ambition is to be the best performing, most trusted and respected consumer products 
company in Africa. Achieving this will require significant leadership focus and investment behind an ambitious growth strategy. Reward is a 
key enabler to this strategy – impacting our ability to not only attract, but to motivate and retain talent with the capability to deliver EABL’s 
strategy and performance goals.
EABL is pleased to present the Directors’ remuneration report for the year ended 30 June 2023. This report is compiled in accordance with 
EABL’s reward policy, relevant provisions of both the CMA Code of Corporate Governance guidelines on Directors’ remuneration and the 
Kenyan Companies Act, 2015. A key provision of the Company’s principles is that reward directly supports the business strategy with clear 
and measurable linkage to business performance.
EABL seeks to recognise the contribution its employees make towards the success of the Company, while reflecting not only the value of the 
roles they perform, but also the level to which they perform them. Our approach to recognising our Directors’ contribution to the business is 
based on our reward principles, which are summarised as below:
•	 Competitiveness: Our reward structure is reviewed regularly and is designed to ensure that we continually offer our Directors a 
competitive total reward package.  
•	 Transparency: Our reward programme is simple and globally aligned, and we strive to explain to all stakeholders the component value 
of the total reward package and the criteria which may affect it.
•	 Performance based: Our reward programmes are linked to our performance ambition. They are simple and clearly communicated, 
recognising individual and business performance.
As at 30 June 2023, EABL’s Board of Directors consisted of:
•	 2 Executive Directors: Ms. Jane Karuku and Ms. Risper G. Ohaga.
•	 2 Non-Executive Directors: Mr. Leo Breen and Mr. Dayalan Nayager

The Companies Act, 2015 requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of 
the financial position of the Group and Company at the end of the financial year and its financial performance for the year then ended. The 
Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Group and Company keep proper accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the transactions of the Group and Company; disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Company; 
and that enables them to prepare financial statements of the Group and Company that comply with prescribed financial reporting standards 
and the requirements of the Companies Act, 2015. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors accept responsibility for the preparation and presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards and in the manner required by the Companies Act, 2015. They also accept responsibility for:
i)	 Designing, implementing and maintaining internal control as they determine necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error;
ii)	 Selecting suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; and
iii)	Making judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
The Directors have made an assessment of the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and have no reason to believe 
the Group and Company will not be a going concern for at least the next twelve months from the date of this statement.
Except on borrowings as disclosed in note 29a, the Group and its subsidiaries have complied with the terms of financial covenants.

Report on the financial statements
Our opinion 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of East African Breweries Plc (the Company) and its subsidiaries (together, 
the Group) set out on pages 144 to 207, which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position at 30 June 2023 and the 
consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in 
equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, together with the Company statement of financial position 
at 30 June 2023, and the Company statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for 
the year then ended, and the notes to the financial statements, which include significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information.
In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and the Company at 30 June 2023 
and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act, 2015.
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are 
further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.
We are independent of the company in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including 
International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code) together 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Kenya. We have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key audit matters (continued)
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Carrying value of intangible assets (goodwill and 
brands) and investments in subsidiaries
As disclosed in Notes 23 and 24 of the financial statements, 
the group has goodwill of Kshs 3.5 billion and indefinite lived 
brand intangible assets of Kshs 613 million as at 30 June 2023 
arising from business acquisitions in prior years. The carrying 
amount of investments in subsidiaries in the Company’s 
statement of financial position at 30 June 2023 was Kshs 47 
billion. 
Management performs an impairment assessment of 
intangible assets and the investment in subsidiaries on an 
annual basis as explained in the accounting policies Note 
2 (h) and 2 (s) of the financial statements. The impairment 
assessment is based on a comparison of the carrying amount 
of the intangible assets and the investments in subsidiaries 
in the statement of financial position to their respective 
recoverable amounts. 
The determination of the recoverable amount, which is the 
higher of value-in-use and fair value less costs to dispose, 
requires management judgement in both identifying and 
valuing the relevant cash generating units (CGUs). Recoverable 
amounts are based on management’s estimate of variables 
and market conditions such as future selling prices and 
sales volume growth rates, the timing of future operating 
expenditure, discount and long-term growth rates and 
terminal values of the assets. Variations in management 
estimates and judgements could result in material differences 
in the outcomes of the assessment.
We evaluated and validated the composition of management’s 
cash flow forecasts and the underlying assumptions based 
on the historical performance of the CGUs, industry specific 
reports and the macro-economic outlook. 
We assessed the appropriateness of the impairment models 
and the reasonableness of the assumptions by benchmarking 
the key market-related assumptions in the models, such as 
discount rates, long term growth rates and foreign exchange 
rates, against external data, and assessed the reliability of cash 
flow forecasts through a review of actual past performance and 
comparison to previous forecasts. 
We tested the mathematical accuracy and performed 
sensitivity analysis of the inputs and assumptions to the 
models. 
We assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the related 
disclosures in Notes 23 and 24 of the financial statements.

Key audit matters (continued)
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Provisions and contingent liabilities
As explained in Note 31 of the financial statements, the group 
entities have unresolved tax assessments and claims by 
Revenue Authorities relating to a range of compliance matters 
in the normal course of business. The Directors use the best 
available information to make significant judgements at the 
year-end as to the likely outcome of these matters for purposes 
of calculating any potential liabilities and/or determining the 
level of disclosures in the financial statements.
As explained in Note 31 of the financial statements, since the 
settlement of these matters is subject to future negotiations 
and legal proceedings, the calculations of any provisions 
are subject to inherent uncertainty. The future outcome of 
these claims could be materially different from the Directors’ 
judgements.
As explained in Note 31 of the financial statements, since the 
settlement of these matters is subject to future negotiations 
and legal proceedings, the calculations of any provisions 
are subject to inherent uncertainty. We assessed the 
reasonableness of any provisions recorded in the financial 
statements in the context of the uncertainty. 
Our audit focused on assessing the reasonableness of the 
Directors’ judgements in relation to unresolved tax assessments 
and claims. In particular, our procedures included the following:
•	 where relevant, assessing independent professional 
opinions used in the management judgements and 
estimates; and
•	 validation of the management judgements and estimates 
against the supporting internal information and documents, 
and communications with relevant tax authorities.  
We evaluated whether the disclosures in the financial 
statements appropriately reflect any significant uncertainties 
that exist around the unresolved tax matters.
Other information 
Report of the independent auditor to the shareholders 
of East African Breweries Plc (continued)
The other information comprises the Corporate information, the Directors’ report, the Directors’ remuneration report, the statement of 
Directors’ responsibilities and the Principal shareholders and share distribution information, which we obtained prior to the date of this 
auditor’s report, and the rest of the other information in the 2023 Integrated Report and Financial Statements which is expected to be 
made available to us after that date, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are 
responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the 
extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in 
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in 
the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If, based on the work we have performed on the other information we have received prior to the date of this auditor’s report we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report 
in this regard.
When we read the rest of the other information in the 2023 Integrated Report and Financial Statements and we conclude that there is 
a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.
142
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act, 2015, and for such internal control as the directors determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either 
intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.  
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the 
audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform 
audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. 
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by the Directors.  
•	 Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions 
may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.  
•	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the 
financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
•	 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the 
Group to express an opinion on the Group’s financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance 
of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, 
and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, related safeguards.
Report of the independent auditor to the shareholders 
of East African Breweries Plc (continued)
143
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (continued)
From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the 
Group’s financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine 
that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected 
to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.  
Report on other matters as prescribed by the Companies Act, 2015 
Report of the Directors
In our opinion, the information given in the Directors’ report on pages 130 to 131 is consistent with the financial statements.
Directors’ remuneration report
In our opinion the auditable part of the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 134 to 137 has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act, 2015.

1. General Information
East African Breweries Plc (the “Company”) is incorporated as a 
limited liability company in Kenya under the Companies Act, 2015 
and is domiciled in Kenya. The address of its registered office and 
principal place of business is as follows:
East African Breweries Plc
Corporate Centre, 
Garden City Business Park, Ruaraka
PO Box 30161
00100 Nairobi GPO
The consolidated financial statements for the Company as at 
30 June 2023 and for the year ended comprise the Company and 
the subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’ and individually 
as ‘Group entities’). 
The Company’s shares are listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange, 
Uganda Stock Exchange and Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange.
For Companies Act, 2015 reporting purposes, the balance sheet 
is represented by the statement of financial position and the 
profit or loss account by the statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income, in these financial statements.
2.	 Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of 
these financial statements are set out below. These policies have 
been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise 
stated. 
(a)	Basis of preparation
(i)	Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and in the 
manner required by the Companies Act, 2015. The measurement 
basis applied is the historical cost basis, except where otherwise 
stated in the accounting policies below.
(ii)	Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and in the 
manner required by the Companies Act, 2015. The measurement 
basis applied is the historical cost basis, except where otherwise 
stated in the accounting policies below.
(iii)	Functional and presentation currency
The financial statements are presented in Kenya Shillings which is the 
Company’s functional currency. All financial statements presented in 
Kenya Shillings have been rounded to the nearest thousand except 
when otherwise indicated.
Items included in the financial statements are measured using the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity 
operates ‘the functional currency’ except where otherwise indicated.
(iv)	Use of judgement and estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS 
requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process 
of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a 
higher degree of judgement or complexity, or where assumptions 
and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are 
disclosed in Note 3.
(v)	New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The following standards and amendments have been applied by the 
Group for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 July 2022:
Annual improvements cycle 2018 -2020
These amendments include minor changes to: 
•	 IFRS 1, ‘First time adoption of IFRS’ has been amended for a 
subsidiary that becomes a first-time adopter after its parent. 
The subsidiary may elect to measure cumulative translation 
differences for foreign operations using the amounts reported by 
the parent at the date of the parent’s transition to IFRS.
•	 IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’ has been amended to include 
only those costs or fees paid between the borrower and the 
lender in the calculation of “the 10% test” for derecognition of a 
financial liability. Fees paid to third parties are excluded from this 
calculation.   
•	 IFRS 16, ‘Leases’, amendment to the Illustrative Example 13 that 
accompanies IFRS 16 to remove the illustration of payments from 
the lessor relating to leasehold improvements. The amendment 
intends to remove any potential confusion about the treatment 
of lease incentives.
IAS 41, ‘Agriculture’ has been amended to align the requirements for 
measuring fair value with those of IFRS 13. The amendment removes 
the requirement for entities to exclude cash flows for taxation when 
measuring fair value.
The application of the amendments had no material impact on the 
consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 37 Onerous Contracts—Cost of Fulfilling a 
Contract
The amendment clarifies which costs an entity includes in assessing 
whether a contract will be loss-making. This assessment is made 
by considering unavoidable costs, which are the lower of the net 
cost of exiting the contract and the costs to fulfil the contract. The 
amendment clarifies the meaning of ‘costs to fulfil a contract’. Under 
the amendment, costs to fulfil a contract include incremental costs 
and the allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling the 
contract.

The application of the amendments had no material impact on the 
consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: 
Proceeds before Intended Use 
The amendment to IAS 16 prohibits an entity from deducting from 
the cost of an item of PPE any proceeds received from selling items 
produced while the entity is preparing the asset for its intended use 
(for example, the proceeds from selling samples produced when 
testing a machine to see if it is functioning properly). The proceeds 
from selling such items, together with the costs of producing them, 
are recognised in profit or loss.  
The application of the amendments had no material impact on the 
consolidated financial statements.
Amendment to IFRS 3, ‘Business combinations’ Asset or liability 
in a business combination clarity
The Board has updated IFRS 3, ‘Business combinations’, to refer to 
the 2018 Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting, in order 
to determine what constitutes an asset or a liability in a business 
combination.
In addition, the Board added a new exception in IFRS 3 for liabilities 
and contingent liabilities. The exception specifies that, for some 
types of liabilities and contingent liabilities, an entity applying IFRS 
3 should instead refer to IAS 37, ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities 
and Contingent Assets’, or IFRIC 21, ‘Levies’, rather than the 2018 
Conceptual Framework.
The Board has also clarified that the acquirer should not recognise 
contingent assets, as defined in IAS 37, at the acquisition date.
The application of the amendments had no material impact on the 
consolidated financial statements.
(vi)	Relevant new standards and interpretations not yet 
adopted by the Group
Amendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or 
Non-Current
The amendment clarifies that liabilities are classified as either current 
or non-current, depending on the rights that exist at the end of the 
reporting period. A number of requirements are required to be met 
in conjunction with this amendment. 
Amendments to IAS 12, Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to 
Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction 
The amendments require companies to recognise deferred tax on 
transactions that, on initial recognition give rise to equal amounts of 
taxable and deductible temporary differences. 
Narrow scope amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial 
Statements’
, Practice statement 2 and IAS 8 ‘Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’
The amendments aim to improve accounting policy disclosures and 
to help users of the financial statements to distinguish changes in 
accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates.
(vii)	 Early adoption of standards
The Group did not early adopt new or amended standards in the 
year ended 30 June 2023.
(b)	Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the results of the 
Company and its subsidiaries. A subsidiary is an entity controlled by 
East African Breweries Plc. Control is the power to direct the relevant 
activities of the subsidiary that significantly affects the subsidiary’s 
return so as to have rights to the variable return from its activities. 
Where the Group has the ability to exercise joint control over an 
entity but has rights to specified assets and obligations for liabilities 
of that entity, the entity is consolidated on the basis of the group’s 
rights over those assets and liabilities.
(i)	 Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date on which control commences until 
the date on which control ceases. Investments in subsidiaries are 
accounted for at cost in the Company’s financial statements.
(ii)	Non-controlling interest (NCI)
NCI are initially measured at their proportionate share of the acquired 
identifiable net assets at the acquisition date. 
(iii)	Changes in the Group’s ownership interests in existing 
subsidiaries
Changes in the Group’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that 
do not result in the Group losing control over the subsidiaries are 
accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amount of the 
Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted 
to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. 
Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling 
interests are adjusted and the fair values of the consideration paid 
or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners 
of the Company.
(iv)	Balances and transactions eliminated at consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income 
and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, 
but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

(c)	Revenue recognition 
The Group recognises revenue from the sale of goods and services 
in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities. The Group recognises 
revenue at a point in time as and when it satisfies a performance 
obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a 
customer. 
The amount of revenue recognised is the amount the Group expects 
to receive in accordance with the terms of the contract, and excludes 
amounts collected on behalf of third parties, such as value-added tax 
(VAT), excises, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating 
sales within the Group.
Revenue is recognised as follows:
(i)	
Sales of goods are recognised in the period in which the Group 
delivers products to the customer, the customer accepts 
the products and collectability of the related receivables is 
reasonably assured. 
(ii)	 Royalty income is recognised based on agreed rates applied on 
net sales value of the related products. 
(iii)	 Management fee is recognised based on actual costs plus an 
agreed mark up.
Generally, payment of the transaction price is due within credit 
period of between 7 to 8 days with no element of financing.
The company does not have contract assets or contract liabilities at 
the reporting date.
(d)	Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised as income in the period in which the 
right to receive the payment is established.
(e)	Finance income and costs
Finance income comprises interest income and foreign exchange 
gains that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents. 
Interest income is recognised in profit or loss on a time proportion 
basis using the effective interest method. Once a financial asset is 
identified as credit-impaired, the effective interest rate is applied 
to the amortised cost (net of impairment losses) in subsequent 
reporting periods.
Finance costs comprise interest expense and foreign exchange 
losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents. 
Interest expense is recognised in profit or loss using the effective 
interest method. 
All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in profit or 
loss within ‘other income/expenses.
(f)	 Foreign currency translation
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency of the respective entity using the exchange rates prevailing 
at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses 
resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the 
translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the 
profit or loss.
Consolidation of Group entities
The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a 
functional currency different from the presentation currency are 
translated into the presentation currency as follows:
•	 assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position 
presented are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date;
•	 income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss and 
other comprehensive income are translated at average exchange 
rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the 
cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, 
in which case income and expenses are translated at actual rates 
at the dates of the transactions); and
•	 all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation 
reserve except to the extent that the translation difference is 
allocated to Non-controlling interest (NCI).
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation 
of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other 
currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are 
taken to other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is 
sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the profit or loss as 
part of the gain or loss on sale. 
If the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary 
that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, then the 
relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to NCI. 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill 
and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into 
presentation currency at the closing exchange rates at the reporting 
date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated 
into the presentation currency at actual exchange rates at the dates 
of the transactions.
(g)	Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost, less 
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Costs include expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the asset. Purchased software that is integral to the 
functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that 
equipment.
Notes (continued)
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
OUR BUSINESS | OUR PERFORMANCE | STRATEGIC REVIEW | CORPORATE GOVERNANCE | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Integrated Report & Financial Statements 2023
159
Expenditure on assets under construction is charged to work in 
progress until the asset is brought into use. Subsequent expenditure 
is capitalised only when it is probable that future economic benefits 
of the expenditure will flow to the Group. Ongoing repairs and 
maintenance are expensed as incurred.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write down the 
cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life 
as follows:
Buildings
25 years or unexpired period of 
lease if less than 25 years
Plant, equipment, furniture and 
fittings
5 – 33 years
Motor vehicles
4 – 5 years
Returnable packaging
5 – 15 years
Freehold land and capital work in progress is not depreciated. 
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed 
annually at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.
Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and 
equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from 
disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment 
and are recognised net within “other income/expenses” in the profit 
or loss. 
(h)	Intangible assets
(i)	 Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of 
the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. 
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of the 
software from the date that they are available for use. The estimated 
useful life is three to five years. 
(ii)	Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over 
the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of 
the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on 
subsidiaries is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. Impairment losses on 
goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on disposal of an entity 
include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of 
impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating 
units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in 
which the goodwill arose.
(iii)	Brands
Brands acquired as part of acquisitions of businesses are capitalised 
as intangible assets if their value can be measured reliably on initial 
recognition and it is probable that the expected future economic 
benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Group. 
Brands are considered to have an indefinite economic life because of 
the institutional nature of the brands and the Group’s commitment 
to develop and enhance their value. The carrying value of these 
intangible assets is reviewed at least annually for impairment and 
adjusted to the recoverable amount if required. 
(i)	 Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s 
statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised 
and derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular way purchases or 
sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of 
assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention 
in the marketplace. 
Classification
The Group classifies its financial instruments into the following 
categories:
(i)	
Financial assets that are held within a business model whose 
objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash 
flows, and for which the contractual terms of the financial 
asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding, are classified and measured at amortised cost;
(ii)	 Financial assets that are held within a business model whose 
objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows 
and selling financial assets, and for which the contractual 
terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash 
flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding, are classified and measured at 
fair value through other comprehensive income;
(iii)	 All other financial assets are classified and measured at fair value 
through profit or loss.
(iv)	 Notwithstanding the above, the Group may:
a)	
on initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for 
trading, irrevocably elect to classify and measure it at fair value 
through other comprehensive income.
b)	
on initial recognition of a debt instrument, irrevocably designate 
it as classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss 
if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or 
recognition inconsistency.

(g)	Property, plant and equipment (continued)

160
(v)	 Financial liabilities that are held for trading (including derivatives), 
financial guarantee contracts, or commitments to provide a 
loan at a below-market interest rate are classified and measured 
at fair value through profit or loss. The Group may also, on initial 
recognition, irrevocably designate a financial liability as at fair 
value through profit or loss if doing so eliminates or significantly 
reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency.
(vi)	 All other financial liabilities are classified and measured at 
amortised cost.
Financial instruments held during the year were classified as follows:
–	 Demand and term deposits with banking institutions, trade and 
other receivables and balances with related parties. These were 
classified as at amortised cost.
–	 Borrowings and trade and other liabilities. These were also 
classified as at amortised cost.
Initial measurement
On initial recognition:
i)	
Financial assets or financial liabilities classified as fair value 
through profit or loss are measured at fair value.
ii)	
Trade receivables are measured at their transaction price.
iii)	 All other categories of financial assets and financial liabilities 
are measured at the fair value plus or minus transaction costs 
that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the 
instrument.
Subsequent measurement
Financial assets and financial liabilities after initial recognition 
are measured either at amortised cost, at fair value through other 
comprehensive income, or at fair value through profit or loss 
according to their classification.
Interest income, dividend income, and exchange gains and losses on 
monetary items are recognised in profit or loss.
Derecognition
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive 
cash flows from the financial asset have expired or have been 
transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and 
rewards of ownership. A financial liability is derecognised when it is 
extinguished, cancelled or expires.
(j)	 Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount 
is reported on the statement of financial position when there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there 
is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle 
the liability simultaneously. 
(k)	Leases 
(i)	 Leases under which the Group is the lessee
On the commencement date of each lease (excluding leases with a 
term of 12 months or less on commencement and leases for which 
the underlying asset is of low value), the Group recognises a right-of-
use asset and a lease liability.
The lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease 
payments that are not paid on that date. The lease payments include 
fixed payments, variable payments that depend on an index or a rate, 
amounts expected to be payable under residual value guarantees, 
and the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably 
certain to exercise that option. The lease payments are discounted 
at the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily 
determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate is used.
For leases that contain non-lease components, the Group allocates 
the consideration payable to the lease and non-lease components 
based on their relative stand-alone components. 
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost comprising the 
initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made 
on or before the commencement date, any initial direct costs 
incurred, and an estimate of the costs of restoring the underlying 
asset to the condition required under the terms of the lease.
Subsequently the lease liability is measured at amortised cost, subject 
to remeasurement to reflect any reassessment, lease modifications, 
or revised fixed lease payments.
Right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, 
adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. Depreciation 
is calculated using the straight-line method to write down the cost 
of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life. If 
ownership of the underlying asset is not expected to pass to the 
Group at the end of the lease term, the estimated useful life would 
not exceed the lease term.
For leases with a term, on commencement, of 12 months or less and 
leases for which the underlying asset is of low value, the total lease 
payments are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over 
the lease period.
(ii)	Leases under which the Group is the lessor
Leases that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of the underlying asset to the lessee are classified as finance leases. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases. Payments received 
under operating leases are recognised as income in the profit and 
loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

(l)	 Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost is based on the weighted average method and expenditure 
incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their 
existing location and condition. The cost of finished goods and work 
in progress comprises an appropriate share of production overheads 
based on normal operating capacity. Net realisable value is the 
estimate of the selling price in the ordinary course of business, less 
the costs of completion and selling expenses. 
(m)	Treasury shares
Treasury shares are shares in East African Breweries Plc that are 
held by the East African Breweries Plc Employee Share Ownership 
Plan for the purpose of issuing shares under the Group’s share 
ownership scheme. Treasury shares are recognised at cost where 
cost is determined to be the purchase price of the shares in an open 
market (Nairobi Securities Exchange). Shares issued to employees are 
recognised on a first-in-first-out basis.
(n)	
Share-based payment arrangements
The Group operates equity-settled share-based compensation plans 
for its employees and executives. 
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured 
at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. The fair 
value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share- 
based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will 
eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of 
each reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number 
of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of 
the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the profit or loss such 
that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a 
corresponding adjustment to share based payment reserve in equity.
(o)	
Employee benefits
(i)	 Retirement benefits obligations
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit 
schemes for some of its employees. The assets of all schemes are 
held in separate trustee administered funds, which are funded by 
contributions from both the Group and employees. The Group and 
all its employees also contribute to the National Social Security 
Funds, which are defined contribution schemes. 
The Group’s contributions to the defined contribution schemes are 
recognised in the profit or loss in the year to which they relate. The 
Group has no further obligation once the contributions have been paid. 
(ii)	Termination benefits
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the 
Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of 
withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to terminate employment 
before the normal retirement date.
(iii)	Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service 
is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be 
paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to 
pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee 
and the obligation can be estimated reliably. 
(p)	
Income tax expense
The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred income 
tax. Tax is recognised in the profit or loss except to the extent that 
it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
Current tax is the amount of tax payable on the taxable profit for the 
year determined in accordance with the relevant tax legislation and 
any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous 
years. The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred 
tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the 
initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not 
a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor 
taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries 
to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. In addition, deferred income tax is not recognised 
for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of 
goodwill. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates that are expected 
to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based 
on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they 
relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same 
taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle 
current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and 
liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
A deferred income tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are 
reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
A tax rate reconciliation that reconciles the notional taxation charge 
as calculated at the Kenya tax rate, to the actual total tax charge is 
prepared on a materiality basis. As a Group operating in multiple 
countries, the actual tax rates applicable to profits in some of 
countries are different from the Kenya tax rate. 
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends 
are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related 
dividend.

(q)	Dividends 
Dividends payable on ordinary shares are charged to retained 
earnings in the period in which they are declared. Proposed dividends 
are not accrued for until ratified in an Annual General Meeting. 
(r)	 Segmental reporting
Segment information is presented in respect of the Group’s 
geographical segments, which is the primary format and is based on 
the countries in which the Group operates. The Group has no other 
distinguishable significant business segments. 
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable 
to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable 
basis. Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis. 
(s)	Impairment 
Impairment of financial assets
The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on 
financial instruments that are measured at amortised cost or at fair 
value through other comprehensive income. The loss allowance is 
measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses 
for trade receivables and for financial instruments for which: (a) the 
credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition; or 
(b) there is observable evidence of impairment (a credit-impaired 
financial asset). If, at the reporting date, the credit risk on a financial 
asset other than a trade receivable has not increased significantly 
since initial recognition, the loss allowance is measured for that 
financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month expected 
credit losses. All changes in the loss allowance are recognised in 
profit or loss as impairment gains or losses.
Lifetime expected credit losses represent the expected credit losses that 
result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial 
instrument. 12-month expected credit losses represent the portion of 
lifetime expected credit losses that result from default events on a financial 
asset that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date.
Expected credit losses are measured in a way that reflects an unbiased 
and probability-weighted amount determined by evaluating a range 
of possible outcomes, the time value of money, and reasonable and 
supportable information that is available without undue cost or 
effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions 
and forecasts of future economic conditions.
Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than 
deferred tax assets and inventories, are reviewed at each reporting 
date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. 
If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of 
an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable asset Group that 
generates cash flows that largely are independent from other assets 
and groups. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. 
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units 
are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the 
other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis. 
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the 
greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific 
to the asset.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other 
assets, an impairment of loss is reversed only to the extent that the 
asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined, net of depreciation and amortisation, 
if no impairment loss had been recognised.
(t)	 Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data 
for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit 
or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during 
the year. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss 
attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of any dilutive 
potential ordinary shares.
(u)	Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that the Group 
incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs 
that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or 
production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use 
or sale, are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets, until such 
a time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or 
sale. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of 
specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets 
is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period 
in which they are incurred.
(v)	Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as ‘share capital’ in equity. Any premium 
received over and above the par value of the shares is classified as 
‘share premium’ in equity. An equity instrument is any contract that 
evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting 
all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by a Group entity are 
recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
(w)	 Cash and cash equivalents 
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash 
equivalents comprise cash in hand, bank balances and deposits held 
at call with the bank's net of bank overdrafts.

(x)	Comparatives
Where necessary, comparative figures have been adjusted to confirm 
with changes in presentation in the current year.
(y)	Returnable packaging
As returnable packaging is the fixed asset of the Group, the 
expectation is that the customer will regularly return them, therefore 
they are not due for payment.
The asset values are maintained accurately through the normal 
depreciation process – where Gross Book Value (GBV) of a Returnable 
Packaging asset is constantly and actively reduced throughout the 
period of useful life in a linear way (normal depreciation).
Depreciation of returnable packaging:
Bottles
Crates
Kegs
5 years
10 years
10 years
The asset quantities must be accurate to ensure that the reported 
quantity of returnable packaging in Fixed Asset Register is reliable and 
represents the total population of bottles/kegs/crates available for 
the business therefore can serve as a basis for commercial planning, 
production planning and enable the right business decisions.
3. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based 
on historical experience and other factors, including expected future 
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. 
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal 
the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have 
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 
addressed below:
(i)	 Impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived 
intangible assets (brand)
Assessment of the recoverable value of an intangible asset, the 
useful economic life of an asset, or that an asset has an indefinite 
life, requires management judgement. The Group annually tests 
whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with 
the accounting policy stated in Note 2(s). The recoverable amounts 
of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-
use calculations as stated in Note 24.
(ii)	Calculation of loss allowance on financial assets
When measuring expected credit loss on financial assets, the Group 
uses reasonable and supportable forward-looking information, 
which is based on assumptions for the future movement of different 
economic drivers and how these drivers will affect each other.
Loss given default is an estimate of the loss arising on default. It is 
based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and 
those that the lender would expect to receive, taking into account 
cash flows from collateral and integral credit enhancements.
(iii)	Tax provisions
The Group is subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. 
Significant judgment is required in determining the Group’s provision 
for taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the 
ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course 
of business. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit 
issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. 
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the 
amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the 
tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. 
Disclosures on contingent liabilities with respect to tax are included 
in Note 31.
(iv)	Property, plant and equipment
Critical estimates are made by the Directors in determining useful 
lives for property, plant and equipment. The rates used are set out in 
Note 2(g) above. Directors also apply estimates in determining the 
existence of returnable packaging materials.
(v)	Lease liabilities
In order to make a judgement to determine the term of the lease and 
the corresponding lease liability, the Directors consider any options 
regarding extension or termination of the lease contract which may 
be available and whether it is probable that such options will be 
exercised.
Unless there is an implicit interest rate contained in the lease 
contract, the discount rate used to calculate the net present value of 
the lease liability is the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. This rate 
is estimated by the Directors to be the rate which would be paid by 
the Group to purchase a similar asset.
(vi)	Provisions and contingent liabilities
Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Company 
has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated 
reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is 
recognised as finance cost.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Company 
has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the 
restructuring either has commenced or has been announced 
publicly. Future operating losses are not provided for.

Contingent liabilities
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or 
non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company, or a present obligation that arises from 
past events but is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation; or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
4.	 Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including credit risk, liquidity risk and market risks which mainly comprise effects 
of changes in debt and equity market prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group’s overall risk management 
programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on its financial performance. 
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to financial risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and 
managing the financial risks. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these financial statements.
The Group has established a risk management committee made up of senior management which is responsible for developing and monitoring 
the Group’s risk management policies. These policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate 
risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. These risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to 
reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group has also established a controls and compliance function, which 
carries out regular and adhoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures. The results are reported to senior management.
Market risk
i) Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk arises on sales, purchases, borrowings and other monetary balances denominated in currencies other than Kenya 
Shillings. Management’s policy to manage foreign exchange risk is to actively manage the foreign currency denominated procurement 
contracts. The Group also enters into short term cash flow hedge contracts using available cash balance. 
In addition, the Group manages the foreign currency exposure on foreign denominated borrowings through foreign exchange forward contracts.
A 5 per cent strengthening of the Kenya shilling against the following currencies at 30 June 2023 would have increased/(decreased) profit for 
the year by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remains constant. The analysis 
was performed on the same basis for 2022.

ii)	 Price risk
The Group does not hold any financial instruments subject to price risk.
iii)	 Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments include bank loans, bank overdrafts and related party borrowings. These are at various 
rates, and they are therefore exposed to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group regularly monitors financing options available to ensure 
optimum interest rates are obtained. 
As at 30 June 2023, an increase/decrease of 1 percentage point would have resulted in a decrease/increase in profit for the year of Kshs 
401,506,653 (2022: Kshs 331,734,860), mainly as a result of higher/lower interest charges on variable rate borrowings.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises 
from bank balances (including deposits with banks and financial institutions), derivative financial instruments, as well as credit exposures to 
customers, including outstanding trade and other receivables, financial guarantees and committed transactions. 
Maximum exposure to credit risk

Credit risk management policy
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from 
defaults. The Group’s exposure and the credit rating of its counterparties are continuously monitored, and the aggregate value of transactions 
concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties. 
Credit risk on deposits with banking institutions is managed by dealing with institutions with good credit ratings.
Trade and other receivables exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise, and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate 
for the customer. The operating units analyse credit risk for each new customer before standard payment and delivery terms are offered, taking 
into account its financial position, past experience and other factors. Individual risk limits are set based on internal ratings. The utilisation of credit 
limits is monitored regularly. In addition, the Group manages credit risk by requiring the customers to provide financial guarantees. 
The Group does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables as the Group has a large 
number of customers which are geographically dispersed. The credit risk associated with receivables is minimal and the allowance expected 
credit losses that the Group has recognised in the financial statements is considered adequate to cover any potentially irrecoverable amounts.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group always measures the loss allowance for trade receivables at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. The expected 
credit losses on trade receivables are estimated using a provision matrix by reference to past default experience of the customer and an 
analysis of the customer’s current financial position, adjusted for factors that are specific to the customers, general economic conditions in 
which the customers operate and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date.

Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of 
recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the Group, and a failure to make contractual 
payments for a period of greater than 365 days past due.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Prudent liquidity risk management 
includes maintaining sufficient cash balances and ensuring the availability of funding from an adequate amount of committed credit 
facilities. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, the Group maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under 
committed credit lines.
Management performs cash flow forecasting and monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient 
cash to meet its operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities at all times so that 
the Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities. The Group’s approach when 
managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, without incurring 
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the reporting 
date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances due within 12 months equal their 
carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.

Capital risk management
The Group’s primary focus is on enhancing shareholder value in the long term by investing in businesses and brands, aiming for continued 
improvement in returns. The Board’s policy emphasises maintaining a robust capital base to instill confidence among investors, creditors, and 
the market, ensuring sustained future business development.
In managing the capital structure, the Group closely monitors two key ratios:
a)	 Net Debt to Equity: As of 30 June 2023, the net debt to equity ratio is x1.61, well below the maximum limit of 3x set by the Company’s 
Articles of Association for directors’ borrowing powers.
b)	 Net Borrowings to EBITDA Leverage: The Group targets a net borrowings to EBITDA leverage of 0.5 to 1.5 times. As of 30 June 2023, the 
reported ratio is 1.63, slightly above the target but within banking covenants of 2.5 to 3.5x. The increase in borrowing levels was influenced 
by macroeconomic challenges, but the Group will prudently manage this ratio to align with risk appetite and maintain compliance with 
key banking covenants.
By adhering to these principles, the Group ensures its sustainability as a going concern while maximising stakeholder returns and supporting 
current and future business development needs.

Fair value measurement
Fair value measurements of financial instruments are presented through the use of a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritises the 
valuation techniques used in fair value calculations. The Group specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to 
those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while 
unobservable inputs reflect the Group’s market assumptions.
The different levels in the fair value hierarchy have been defined as follows:
i)	 Level 1 fair value measurements are derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active trading markets for identical assets or liabilities. This 
level includes listed debt and equity instruments traded mainly on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (“NSE”).
ii)	 Level 2 fair value measurements are derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (i.e. as a price) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). 
iii)	Level 3 fair value measurements are derived from valuation techniques that include inputs that are not based on observable market data 
(unobservable inputs).
The Group maintains policies and procedures to value instruments using the most relevant data available. If multiple inputs that fall into 
different levels of the hierarchy are used in the valuation of an instrument, the instrument is categorised on the basis of the most subjective 
input.
Foreign currency forward contracts are valued using discounted cash flows technique that incorporate the prevailing market rates. Under 
this technique, future cash flows are estimated based on forward exchange rates (from observable forward exchange rates at the end of the 
reporting period), discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk of the counterparties.
As significant inputs to the valuation are observable in active markets, these instruments are categorised as level 2 in the hierarchy. Other 
investments are carried at cost as there is no suitable basis for its valuation and are therefore categorised as level 3 in the hierarchy.

5.	 Operating segments
Directors have determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Group Executive Committee that are used to make 
 
strategic decisions. The Group Executive Committee includes the Group Managing Director and the Group Chief Financial Officer.
The Group Executive Committee considers the business from a geographical perspective. Geographically, the Group Executive Committee 
considers the performance of the business in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Exports to South Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi and the Great Lakes 
Region are recognised in the country of origin.
The reportable operating segments derive their revenue primarily from brewing, marketing and selling of drinks, malt and barley. The Group 
Executive Committee assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of net sales value.

Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the year to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one year. Segment revenue is based on the 
geographical location of both customers and assets. The revenue from external parties reported to the Group Executive Committee is measured in a manner consistent with that in the 
statement of profit or loss. There is no reliance on individually significant customers by the Group. The amounts provided to the Group Executive Committee in respect to total assets and total 
liabilities are measured in a manner consistent with that of the statement of financial position.

14.	 Dividends
Management recommends that the Board approves the proposal to declare final dividend of Kshs 1.75 per share (2022: Kshs 7.25 per share) 
amounting to Kshs 1.384 billion (2022: Kshs 5.734 billion). An interim dividend of Kshs 3.75 per share for 2023 (2022: Kshs 3.75 per share) was 
paid in April 2023. The total dividend pay-out for the year will therefore be Kshs 5.5 per share (2022: Kshs 11 per share) amounting to Kshs 
4.349 billion (2022: Kshs 8.699 billion).
Payment of dividends is subject to withholding tax at a rate of 0%, 5%, 10% and 15% depending on the residence and the percentage 
shareholding of the respective shareholders.
15.	 Earnings per share
Basic and diluted earnings per share
The calculation of basic earnings per share at 30 June 2023 was based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of Kshs 9,857,351,000 
(2022: Kshs 11,857,336,000) and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 30 June 2023 of 
790,774,356 (2022: 790,774,356). The basic and diluted earnings per share are the same as there is no dilutive effect.

17.	 Other reserves
(a)	Employee share-based payment reserves
The Company operates three equity settled employee share ownership plans (ESOPs) as follows:
a)	 Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP) – Under the plan, an employee is given an option to buy units at a future date but at a fixed 
price, which is set at the time when the option is granted. The vesting period for the shares is three years after which an employee 
can exercise the option within seven years. There are no performance conditions attached to this share plan. 
b)	 Restricted Share Units (RSU) – Effective financial year 2020, the Group introduced RSU. RSU are shares offered for free i.e. at no 
subscription price as at grant date. The vesting period for the shares is three years after which an employee can exercise the option 
within seven years. There are no performance conditions attached to this share plan.
c)	 Employees Share Save Scheme (ESSS) – This plan enables the eligible employee to save a fixed amount of money over a three‐
year period. If an employee joins the plan, he or she is given an option to buy units at a future date at a fixed price set at the grant 
date. The grant price is fixed at 80% of the market price at grant date. The vesting period for the shares is three years after which an 
employee can exercise the option within seven years. There are no performance conditions attached to this share plan.
The reserves that arise from employee share based payments are as follows: 
(b)	  Treasury shares reserve

Share based payments are measured at fair value at the grant date, which is expensed over the period of vesting. The fair value of each option 
granted is estimated at the date of grant using Black Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions supporting inputs into the model for 
options granted during the period are as follows:

Share based payment reserves are not distributable.
(d)	 Currency translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations. 
Exchange differences relating to the translation of the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations from their functional currency to the 
Group’s presentation currency (Kenya shillings) are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign 
currency translation reserve. Exchange differences previously accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve are reclassified to profit 
or loss on disposal or partial disposal of a foreign operation. Translation reserves are not distributable.

The Group leases space for offices, motor vehicles and office equipment. The leases of office space is for an average of 10 years with an option 
to renew. The Directors were not reasonably certain that the option to renew the lease would be exercised at the expiry of the lease. The 
option has therefore not been considered in determining the lease term. The leases of motor vehicles are on average 4 to 5 years, while the 
leases of office equipment are for periods of not more than 12 months.

The balance represents the purchase price allocation to the “Premium Serengeti Lager” brand at acquisition of Serengeti Breweries Limited.
(c) Impairment testing for cash-generating units containing goodwill and brand
(i) Impairment testing methodology
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s operating segments which represent the lowest level within the 
Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. 
The recoverable amount of an operating segment is determined based on a detailed 5-year model that has been extrapolated in perpetuity 
by applying the long-term growth rate of the country. Profit has been amended with working capital and capital expenditure requirements. 
The net cash flows have been discounted using the country-specific pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC). These calculations use 
cash flow projections approved by management covering a 5-year period. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using 
estimated terminal growth rates.

1. Weighted average growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the projected period.
2. Pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections.
These assumptions have been used for the analysis of each operating segment. Management determined forecast profit margin based on 
past performance and its expectations for market developments. The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts 
included in industry reports. 
(iii)	Results of impairment testing on the carrying amount of goodwill and brand
Goodwill
Based on the above assumptions and considering the forecast sales growth rates, operating profits and cash inflows, the recoverable value of 
the relevant operating segment exceeded the carrying net asset amount (including the goodwill) for SBL, UDV and IDU at 30 June 2023. As 
a result, the Group has not recognised an impairment charge (2022: Nil).
Brand
Based on the above assumptions and considering the forecast sales growth rates, operating profits and cash inflows, the recoverable value of 
the brand exceeded the carrying value at 30 June 2023. As a result, the Group has not recognised an impairment charge (2022: Nil).
(iv)	Significant estimates: Impact of possible changes in key assumptions
There were no reasonably possible changes in any of the key assumptions that would have resulted in an impairment charge for SBL, UDV 
and IDU goodwill and the SBL brand.

Impairment assessment
An impairment assessment of the carrying amount of the investment in SBL at Company level was performed at the end of the year using 
the value-in-use model. The key assumptions used in the value-in-use model are shown in Note 23. Based on the assumptions, the carrying 
amount of the investment was lower than the recoverable amount.
Significant estimate: Impact of possible changes in key assumptions
If the budgeted cash flows used in the value-in-use calculation for SBL had been 10% lower than management’s estimates at 30 June 2023, 
the Company would not have recognised any impairment against the carrying amount of the investment in subsidiary (2022: Nil). 
If the pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections for SBL had been 1% higher than management’s estimates (18.50% instead 
of 17.50%), the Company would not have to recognise an impairment against the carrying value of the investment in subsidiary (2022: Nil).
If the terminal growth rate applied to the cash flow projections for SBL had been 1% lower than management’s estimates (3.50% instead of 
4.50%), the Company would not have had to recognise any impairment against the carrying value of the investment in subsidiary (2022: Nil).

As of June 30, 2023, one of the Group’s subsidiaries has reported a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.1, which is above the financial covenant 
provision of 3.5 due to a one-off tax settlement impacting its EBITDA. However, the financing covenants allow the company to regularise the 
non-compliance through an equity cure within 110 days after June 30, 2023. EABL is willing and able to undertake the equity cure within the 
prescribed period, and as a result, the Directors have classified the loan as a long-term loan. This disclosure is provided to offer transparency 
while maintaining the company’s ability to resolve the situation positively and responsibly within the allowed timeframe.
The Group had available undrawn facilities of Kshs 10.4 billion as at June 30, 2023 (2022: Kshs 11.8 billion).

31.	 Contingent liabilities
The Group has operations in several countries and is subject to a number of legal, customs duty, excise duty and other tax claims incidental 
to these operations, the outcome of which cannot at present be foreseen and the possible loss or range of loss of which cannot at present 
be meaningfully quantified. In particular, the Group is subject to certain claims in the markets that the Group operates in that challenge its 
interpretation of various tax regulations and the application thereof. 
Based on their own judgement and professional advice received from legal, tax and other advisors, the Directors believe that the provision made for 
all these claims sufficiently covers the expected losses arising from them. For most of these cases, the likelihood that the Group will suffer significant 
charges or payments is remote; however, in a few cases the Directors consider it possible but not probable that such charges will be incurred. 
The Group continues to vigorously defend its position. The Directors continue to monitor the development of these matters and to the 
extent those developments may have a major impact on its financial position, or may significantly affect its ability to meet its commitments, 
the Group shall disclose those developments in line with its listing obligations as required by relevant regulations.
Kenya Breweries Limited (KBL), a subsidiary of EABL, was involved in a number of protracted excise duty disputes with the Kenya Revenue 
Authority (KRA) over locally produced keg beer. In January 2021, the Cabinet Secretary of Treasury (CS) approved the abandonment of taxes 
demanded by KRA, as per the provisions of section 37 of the Tax Procedures Act.  KBL settled the agreed amount of Kshs 3.5bn, and the 
KRA abandoned the taxes and closed all the cases. However, in April 2023, the Cabinet Secretary issued a letter revoking the abandonment, 
citing advice from the KRA and lack of justification for the abandonment. Shortly thereafter, KBL received a demand letter from the KRA for 
immediate payment of Kshs 8.2bn. KBL sought legal advice and has extensive documentation showing the involvement and approval of both 
the Cabinet Secretary and KRA in the abandonment process. Based on independent legal advice, the Directors believe that the company 
lawfully obtained the abandonment of assessed tax in 2021 and its petition at the High Court has strong grounds to succeed.

authorised attorney of such corporate body.

As a shareholder you are entitled to appoint one or more proxies to exercise all or any of your shareholder rights to attend, speak and 
vote on your behalf at the meeting. The appointment of the Chairman of the meeting as proxy has been included for convenience. To 
appoint as a proxy any other person, delete the words “the Chairman of the Meeting or” and insert the full name of your proxy in the 
space provided. A proxy need not to be a shareholder of the Company.
4.	
Completion and submission of the form of proxy will not prevent you from attending the meeting and voting at the meeting in person, 
in which case, any votes cast by your proxy will be excluded.
5.	
A vote “abstain” option has been included on the form of proxy. The legal effect of choosing this option on any resolution is that you will 
be treated as not having voted on the relevant resolution. The number of votes in respect of which votes are withheld will, however, be 
counted and recorded, but disregarded in calculating the number of votes for or against each resolution.

utakaofanyika mnamo 14 Septemba, 2023.
Idhini ya kutumiwa kwa Nambari ya Simu iliyotolewa
NINGEPENGA/TUNGEPENDA kutoa idhini yangu/yetu ya kutumiwa kwa nambari ya simu 
niliyoitoa/tuliyoitoa kwa ajili ya kupiga kura katika AGM.
Maelezo:  
1.	
Iwapo mwanachama atashindwa kuhudhuria yeye binafsi, Fomu hii ya Uwakilishi inafaa kujazwa na kutumwa kupitia barua pepe kwa 
eabl.agm@eabl.com au iwasilishwe (pamoja na barua ya idhini ya wakili au mamlaka nyingine (iwapo itakuwepo) ambayo imetiwa 
saini chini yake au nakala ya cheti cha kutoa idhini au mamlaka ambacho kimetiwa muhuri) kwa Image Registrars Limited, Ghorofa ya 
5, jumba la Absa Towers (zamani ikiitwa Barclays Plaza), Loita Street, S.L.P. 9287-00100 GPO Nairobi ili ipokelewe kabla ya Jumanne 12 
Septemba, 2023 saa tano asubuhi (11:00 a.m.), yaani si chini ya saa 48 kabla ya wakati wa kufanyika kwa mkutano, au iwapo utaahirishwa 
au, iwapo kura itapigwa baada ya tarehe ya kufanyika kwa mkutano, au baada ya mkutano ulioahirishwa, sio chini ya saa 24 kabla ya 
wakati uliowekwa kwa kura kupigwa ambayo hupigwa zaidi ya saa 48 baada ya kufanyika kwa mkutano au mkutano ulioahirishwa.
2.	
Iwapo anayeteua mwakilishi ni kampuni au shirika, Fomu ya Uwakilishi inafaa kupigwa mhuri rasmi wa kampuni au kuidhinishwa na afisa 
au wakili aliyeidhinishwa kuiwakilisha kampuni au shirika hilo.
3.	
Kama mwenyehisa, una haki ya kumteua mwakilishi au wawakilishi wa kutekeleza haki zako zote au baadhi ya haki zako kama 
mwenyehisa na kuzungumza na kupiga kura kwa niaba yako katika mkutano. Uteuzi wa Mwenyekiti kama mwakilishi umetolewa kama 
njia moja ili kurahisisha mambo. Ili kuteua mtu mwingine kuwa mwakilishi, piga kalamu maneno ‘Mwenyekiti wa Mkutano aliyeteuliwa” 
na uandike majina kamili ya mwakilishi wako katika nafasi iliyotolewa. Mwakilishi sio lazima awe mwenyehisa wa Kampuni.
4.	
Kujazwa na kuwasilishwa kwa fomu ya uwakilishi hakutakuzuia wewe mwenyewe kuhudhuria na kupiga kura mkutanoni, ambapo, 
iwapo itafanyika, kura itakayopigwa na mwakilishi wako haitahesabiwa.
5.	
Chaguo la “kususia” limeorodheshwa kwenye sehemu ya kupiga kura kwenye fomu hii ya uwakilishi. Matokeo ya kisheria ya kutumia 
chaguo hili kwenye azimio lolote ni kwamba utahesabiwa kama mtu ambaye hakupigia kura azimio hilo. Idadi ya kura zilizosusiwa, hata 
hivyo, itahesabiwa na kurekodiwa, lakini hazitatumiwa katika kuhesabu idadi ya kura zilizounga mkono au kupinga kila azimio.
